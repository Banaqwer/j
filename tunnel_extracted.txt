THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
CHAPTEK I
IN^theextreme northeastern comer oftheLone Star
State ofTexas, about eight miles west ofTexar-
kana, inalonely farm-house onSunday morning, June
10th, Amelia Gordon turned over inherbedand
watched thesunlight streaming thru thewindow on
thehead ofhernew-bom son. Shehadalways hoped
that this,herthird son,would bebomonSunday, but
hewasborn lateSaturday night, June 9th,1906.A
fewmonths before hisbirth, hismother had suffered
asevere shock onaccount ofthedeath ofheroldest son
intheSanFrancisco earthquake inApril, andfora
time itwasfeared thatherthird sonmight never be
born tolive. Shewashappy thisSunday morning
when shelooked atherbouncing baby boy,dreamed
ofhisfuture, andthought ofwhat hisname should be.
Calvin Gordon, thebaby's father, hadbeenaCaptain
intheU.S.Army inSpain. Hehadwon distinction
forhiscoolcourage anddaring nerve, andafter theclose
oftheSpanish-American war,moved from Tennessee
toTexas. Capt. Gordon hadbeenverymuch depressed
after the lossofhiseldest sonintheSanErancisco
earthquake, andwasverymuch cheered upatthebirth
ofthisboy,andhoped thattheyoungest sonmight ful-
filltheambitions hehadforhisfirstborn.

2 THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
Ithadalways been thecustom ofCalvin andAmelia
Gordon togotothelittle country church every Sunday
morning, butthismorning Capt.Gordon remained with
hiswife sothatthey could talkover thenaming of
their son. Capt. Gordon suggested thename ^'Robert,"
which wasthename ofhisfather, andhiswife quickly
acquiesced, sothebabywasnamed Robert.
Amelia Gordon wasagreat Bible student, andhad
always hoped thatshewould have asonbornwhowould
beapreacher, soshethought that little Robert might
fulfill herhopes andambitions.
Capt. Gordon wasafarmer, growing mostly cotton
crops ontheRedRiver bottom lands. Thefollowing
year, 1907, after thebirth oflittle Robert, Capt. Gor-
don's crops were almost afailure. TheSpring was
lateandoverflows damaged cotton. This, together with
unfavorable financial conditions, caused apanic inthe
United States intheFall of1907. Thus the firstyear
oftheboy's lifestarted under unfavorable conditions.
When Robert wasalittle overtwoyears old, his
mother gave birth toagirl, the firstborn toher,but
stillsheshowed great interest inRobert ;talked much
ofhisfuture andtookgreat interest inteaching him to
liveaccording totheBible.
Atabout theageof^yo, hismother began toteach
himthealphabet. Helearned veryquickly howtoread
andwrite, before hestarted toschool. Hewasalways
willing andglad togotoSunday School with his
mother, tookagreat interest inthesermon, andwhat
theSunday School teacher hadtosayabout thecreation
oftheworld, andabout God's great plan.

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 S
Little Robert went tochurch onedayandthepreacher
took histextfrom 1Thes. 4:16-18, ''For theLord him-
selfshall descend fromHeaven with ashout, with the
voice ofthearchangel andwith thetrump ofGod ;and
thedead inChrist shall rise first:Thenwewhich are
aliveandremain, shallbecaught uptogether withthem
intheclouds, tomeet theLord intheair :andsoshall
weeverbewith theLord. Wherefore comfort onean-
other with these words."
Robert wasverymuch interested inthissermon, and
asked hismother toexplain howtheLord could descend
fromHeaven andwhat kind ofvehicle wewould ride
inifwewere caught upintheclouds tomeet theLord
intheair.Hismind puzzled over thisforweeks and
months, andhewasanxious tounderstand more about
it.Hesaid, "Mother, Ishould liketomeet theLord
intheair."
Hismother said,"You willbeable todososome
day,Bobbie."
When inSunday School oneday, theteacher read
from 2Thes. 1:7-8,"And toyouwhoaretroubled rest
with us;when theLord Jesus shall berevealed from
Heaven with hismighty angels, inflaming firetaking
vengeance onthem thatknow notGod,andthatobey
notthegospel ofourLord Jesus Christ." Thepreacher
said thattheLordhadplaced therainbow inthesky
asatestimony thathewould never again destroy the
world bywater, butexplained thatGodwould come
again inaflame offireandthus takevengeance on
thosewhodidnotbelieve anddestroy theworld byfire.
Robert wanted toknow ifthegoodLordwho loves us

4 THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
somuch would destroy tlieworld and allofthose in
it.Hismother explained thatGodwould destroy those
thatwere sinners andrebelled against himandhadnot
accepted hisword.
Bobbie wasinSunday School again andheard them
readfrom 1Tim. 2:11-14: "Let thewoman learn in
silence with allsubjection. ButIsuffer notawoman
toteach, nortousurp authority over theman, butto
beinsilence. ForAdam was firstformed, then Eve.
AndAdam wasnotdeceived; butthewoman being
deceived, was inthetransgression." Heasked the
Sunday School teacher toexplain what thismeant,—^by
learning insilence andsubjection. Healsowanted an
explanation ofthestatement thatawoman should not
teach, because hesaidthathismother hadalways taught
himandloved him,andhisfather hadpaidnoatten-
tion tohimandhadnodesire toteach him.Hewanted
toknow ifitwaswrong forhismother toteach him,
and ifGodwould punish her.Theteacher replied that
theLord said, "Suffer the little children tocome unto
me,andforbid them not,forofsuch istheKingdom
ofGod." Sheexplained thathismother setanexample
more byherloveanddevotion thanbywords; thata
mother's actions would influence achildmore than any-
thing shecould say,and thiswas thegreat silent
teaching.
Robert often visited thecolored mammies ontheplan*
tation andlistened totheghost stories they told,andthe
fearwascreated inhismind ofthespirits thatwalked
inthenight. Hewasoften afraid that thegoblins
would gethim ifhedidn't watch out.OneSunday at

church, th^preacher took forhistextGen. 1:7, "'Fov
Godhasnotgiven usthespirit offear, butofpower
andofloveandofasound mind." When Robert heard
this,hewanted toknowhow itwasthatweshould fear
things, ifGodhadnotgiven usthespirit offearnor
created thespirit offear inus,butgaveusaspirit of
power andofloveandofsound mind. Hismother
explained tohimthattheghost andthefearofthedark
\which theolddarkies toldhimabout, werenothing but
superstition, andheshould banish itfrom hismind.
AfewSundays later, theminister took histextfrom
2Tim. 3:1,^^Thisknow also,thatinthelastdays peril-
oustimes shall come.'^ Robert wasanxious toknow
when thelastdayswould come. Hismother toldhim
itwould beatthetime oftheendoftheworld andGod
would again come todestroy theworld byfire.
Theminister continued toreadfrom 2Tim. 3:15,
"And thatfrom achild thou hastknown theholy scrip-
tures, which areable tomake theewiseunto salvation
through faith which isinChrist Jesus." Robert was
desirous ofknowing ifchildren could teachmore about
thescriptures thangrown people. Hismother toldhim
thattheBible said,"A little child shall leadthem,"
andthatanyone whowould harm little children, can
innowise enter intotheKingdom ofHeaven.

CHAPTER II
IN"1913, Robert suffered asevere illness inthe
Spring, andforafewmonths hislifewasdespaired
of,buthequickly recovered. Soon after hisrecovery,
hisfather tookhimonafishing trip toSpirit Lakc\
The olddarky ofslavery dayswent along, andwhjic
hewasputting worms onRobert's hook, toldthestc;
about thislakeandwhy itwasnamed "Spirit Lake.
Theolddarky said thatthespirit ofabeautiful lady
walked onthewaters ofthelake atnight andthat w.is
whythey called itSpirit Lake.
Long, long years ago, thedaughter ofawealtliy
planter fellinlovewith apoorbuthonest boyandafter
many years ofcourtship, inwhich they spentmany
moonlight nights rowing onthebeautiful lake, thetime
camewhen they feltthattheycould nolonger besepa-
rated. Theyoungmanpleaded with herfather tocr.i-
sent totheir marriage, buthestubbornly refused aji ;
threatened tokilltheyoungman ifheever called at
hishome again. They thenplanned toelope oneniglt-

ontlielakeandfound herbody floating onthewater.
Hesaid thatthefishwould always bite better atfull
moon, butthedarkies were afraid tofishthere because
thespirit ofthisbeautiful young ladywalked onthe
water.
Bobbie camehome verymuch interested andexcited
^ndtold hismother allabout the fishthey caught at
Spirit Lake andabout thestory oldMoses toldhim
about thespirit walking onthewater. Hetold his
mother thattheSunday School teacher hadread inthe
Bible where Christ walked onthewater, andhewanted
hertoexplain how thiscould happen. Shetoldhim
that allofthose things happened inthedays ofmiracles
which hadpassed andnolonger happened inthese days.
Bobbie hadagreat desire towalk orrideupon the
water, andwas enthusiastic about bicycles. Hetold
hismother thatheintended tobuild abicycle someday
thathecould rideonthewater.
In1914, when warbroke out,Capt. Gordon, who
hadonce served intheSpanish-American War,became
verymuch interested intheconflict andfollowed itvery
closely, reading thepapers daily andtalking about it.
Robert soonbegan totakegreat interest inthewarand
asked hisfather andmother many questions about the
foreign countries which were involved inthegreat strug-
gle.Hewould sitforhours, listening tohismother
readtheBible, from theBook ofRevelation, theprophe-
ciesoftheGreat War, where itsays thatnation shall
riseagainst nation.
Robert's mother toldhimofhisgrandfather who dis-
tinguished himself intheCivilWar,andthegreat hard-

8 THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
ships hermother had togothru during thewar
days;howhergreat-grandfather fought intheWar of
1812. Shetalked ofhisgrandfather, Colonel Robert
Gordon, forwhom hewasnamed, andhowhebecame
famous during theCivilWar, andhow later Robert's
ownfather went with Colonel Roosevelt andbecame a
Captain intheSpanish-American War in1898. Rob-
ert's oldest brother, Herbert, wasborn in1894, and
hissecond brother, Ralph, wasborn in1898 after his
father went tothewar.Hismother spentmany anxious
months andworried with thechildren while Capt. Gor-
donwasaway atwar. Sheprayed thatwarwould be
ended foralltime.
She said, "Bobbie, youcome from ageneration of
fighters onboth sides, butIhope thatyouwillbea
minister andpreach against war. While thetragic
death ofyour brother Herbert inSanFrancisco was
ashock thatIhave never fully recovered from, yetI
hadrather know thathewent thatwaythan tohave
himgotowarand losehis life. Iremember well the
many sleepless nights thatIhave passed thru while
your father wasaway atwarandhowhappy Iwas
when hereturned. Iprayed toGodthen thatwarmight
beended andthatnone ofmysonswould everhave to
gotowar."
"Mother," saidBobbie, "when Igettobeaman, I
willbeapreacher and tellthepeople tobepeaceful and
stop fighting, butwhy doesn't Godstopthewar?"
"My son,war isthework ofthedevil, notofGod,
andtheBible tellsusthattheolddragon hastobeloosed
foralittle season, butintheBook ofRevelation, we


=== PAGE BREAK ===

read thatSatan isbound forathousand years. Ihope
Ilive toseethatdayandIfeelsureyou will.Afew
nights before youwerebom Ihadaverystrange dream.
Ithought IsawSanFrancisco andLosAngeles de-
stroyed intwodaysbysomewarmachine, andthat
oneofmysonscame near losing hislifethere, butwas
saved andafterwards hesaved hiscountry andmade
peace with theworld. Isuppose Idreamed about San
Francisco because Herbert losthislifethere but,some-
how, Ifeelthat itwasmore than adream, andthat
youarebom tobeapeacemaker."
Bobbie was greatly impressed with hismother's
dream andherhopes andambitions forhim, buthis
brother would quarrel andtrytofightwithhim. Bob-
biewould tellhimthatDadwanted him tobepeaceful
andthat hismother wanted him tobeapeacemaker
andthathewould not fight. Llisbrother called him
^^Cottonhead" because hishairwassowhite, andaccused
him ofbeing awhite-livered coward, butBobbie was
patient anddidnotlosehistemper. Hismother would
commend himforthisand tellhimthattheBible said
tocontrol yourtemper andnotletyourangry passions
rise.
About thistimesome oftheprejudice which little
Robert hadinherited from hisgrandfather andfrom his
father, began toshow forth. Unfavorable conditions
thruout thecountry andthelowprice ofcotton left
Capt. Gordon practically penniless, causing himand
allofhischildren tolabor hard inorder tosupport
themselves. Hetried toforceyoung Robert towork in
thefieldsandhelp cultivate thecotton, buthestubbornly

rebelled. Hewould playaround thehouse, usehis
father's toolsandtalkabout thegreat inventions that
hewasgoing tomake. Hismother wasalways in
sympathy withEobert andtried toencourage him, but
shecould never gethim totakeaninterest inworking
onafarm. Hetalked ofbeing apreacher, talked of
great inventions and discoveries, butwould notwork
athard labor.
In1917,when theUnited States entered theWorld
War,young Robert waseleven years old.Hehadgreat
ambitions tojoin theArmy andgotothewar. His
older brother Ralph joined theArmy. Young Robert
said that ifhecould notgoand fight forhiscountry
hewould stay athome andwork onapatent which
would helpthem towinthewar.Hedidnotagree or
getalong with hisolder brother andwasgladwhen he
hadgoneaway towar. Hisparents were stillinpoor
circumstances butthey could notinduce young Robert
todoanywork onthefarm. Hecontinued totinker
around andwork with hisfather's tools, trying tomake
abicycle which hecould rideupon thewater inthe
lakenearby. Hetried various kinds oflumber tobuild
wheels forthebicycle butnone ofthemworked success-
fully. Finally hismother suggested thatheusethin
cedar boards because cedar wasdurable inthewater,
waslightandwould float easily. Hefinally succeeded
inbuilding thewheels outofcedar andafter heating
pine rosin hotandpouring itintothecracks, hewas

Bobbie wasnotthekind tobediscouraged byobstacles
andlater hisingenuity overcame thedifficulties. After
trying toputinner tubes from bicycle tiresonthein-
sideofthewheels ofhiswater bicycle andfailing again,
hefinally gotsome inner tubesfrom anautomobile and
placed them inside hiswooden wheels andpumped them
up.When theywere filledwith air,theypushed against
thewooden sides ofthewheel, buoying upthewheel, and
hewasthen able toride hisbicycle around over the
lakewithout anytrouble.
Hismother wasveryproud ofhimandsaid ^^Bobbie,
onedayyourdream ofbecoming agreat inventor will
herealized. Youhave notbeen wasting your time
tinkering around withyour father's tools trying tomake
things." His brother, Ralph, continued tocallhim
"Fool Bobbie" and^'Mother's dream"; saidhewould
never amount toanything because hewouldn't workon
thefarm liketherestofthem. Bobbie always found
awilling listener inhismother. Shehelped himwith
hisstudies inschool andencouraged himineveryway
andshowed thatshebelieved inhimandhadfaith that
onedayhewould beagreatman. Thisencouraged him
todogreater things.
Thesuccess with thewater bicycle hadkindled his
ambition andcreated adesire tocomplete other inven-
tions thathehadinmind. Hetold hismother ofa

theocean thru theair; thathewasriding thebird

andthathereceived agreattriumph andreception when
hevisited theforeign countries, andhowhisownpeople
received him ingreat glorywhen hereturned. His
father called these stories "pipe dreams," but his
mother took great interest inthem andalways encour-
aged him. Robert talked very little tohisfather or
brother butalways went tohismother andtalked over
things andconfided inher. Sheencouraged him be-

after her eldest sonhad died,—thatGod might

Robert wasentirely strange anddifferent from other
boys.Henever seemed towant toplaywiththem, but

andmade aconfidant ofhismother only. Sheseemed
tounderstand him asnoone elsedidandhealways

Robert's mother ofter talked toCapt. Gordon about
him—^toldhimthathewasapeculiar andmostunusual
child andthatshethought that hisrefusal towork at
manual laborwasnotbecause hewaslazybutbecause
shebelieved thathehadasuperior mind, andthat if
properly educated andtrained, hewould become agreat
mansome day,anhonor tohisparents. Shetoldhim
thatBobbie hadadvanced ideas fully ahundred years
ahead ofhistimeandthatheshould beeducated and
allowed tofollow hisown ideas. His father, failing

togetaneducation andtravel around theworld tosee

Walter Kennelworth alsohadambitions ofbecoming
asoldier andofmaking newdiscoveries andinventions
along chemical lines. Hishopes andaspirations were
toonedaybecome agreat chemist. Thevast difference
intheenvironment andconditions under which these
twoboyshadbeenbrought upseemed tomake nodif-
ference intheir friendship. Itripened astheyears
went by.Robert andWalter were often together and
Walter often invited Robert tohisfather's home. Wal-
ter's father andmother became veryfond ofRobert.
When thearmistice came in1918, Robert talked with
hismother and father, asking them ifthatwould be
thelastwar. They, ofcourse, expressed thehope that
itwould be,andRobert saidthathehadread theBible
andthought thatthegreatest warinhistory wasyetto
come.Hebegan toexpress ideas aboutnewinventions,
years ahead ofthetimes. Hebegged hisfather and
mother tolethim leave school andgotowork inan
automobile factory where hecould learn about machin-
eryandunderstand how tocomplete theinventions
which hewasalways talking about.
School wasover intheSummer of1919, andMr.
J.H.Kennelworth, Walter's father, offered Robert a
position inhisoffice during thesummer months. After
business, Walter andRobert would often gooutauto-
mobile riding. Along inJuly, hemetwith aserious
accident. Theautomobile wasoverturned andRobert's
armwasbroken, andhesuffered internal injuries. He
wastaken tothehospital where helayforseveral weeks
before recovery. Hismother wasverymuch worried
andalarmed over thisaccident, andthought itwasbest

forBobbie toreturn tothefarm andnotwork inthe
cityanymore.
Hisbrother Ralph had justreturned from France,
where hehadmetwithmany obstacles inthewarbut
hadreceived noserious injury. Robert wenthome for
arestafter theaccident. Hehadmany disagreements
and fights with hisolder brother, and itseemed tobe
impossible togetalong. Allofthetrouble occurred over
thefact thatRobert would notwork onthefarm, or
help hisbrother.
Bobbie prevailed upon hismother tolethimgoback
toschool intheFallbecause hewasmaking great prog-
ressandhoped tohave abigposition some daywith
Mr.Kennelworth's firm.
IntheFall of1919, hereturned toschool, butmade
slow progress inhisstudies. Hishealth w^asnotgood;
heseemed unable toconcentrate ormakemuch progress.
Hebarely passed hisexaminations attheendofthe
year, butcontinued tostudy hardandmake progress in
mathematics and history. Ingrammar, writing and
geography hewasalways falling below hismarks, and
Walter Kennelworth hadtohelphim out.
FntheSpring of1920, justbefore theclose ofschool,
Robert's father obtained help tocultivate thecotton
plantation. Hethought itbestthatRobert should come
home thatsummer andhelp towork onthefarm, but
again theboyrefused, andmetwithstubborn opposition
andabuse from hisbrother, who called him ^^the fool
inventor" andsaidthathewould never amount toany-
thing because herefused toworkonthefarm. Hesaid
thathewanted tobe'^Gentleman Robert," andcalled

himthe"white-collar boy." These disagreements and
disputes with hisbrother were veryannoying and dis-
appointing toRobert's mother, because shewanted the
children togetalong inpeace. Robert toldhismother
thatonaccount ofhisbrother hew^ould never live at
home again; thathewould continue tostayinTexar-
kanaandgotoschool until hehadfinished hiseduca-
tion,andthenhewould gotowork forMr.Kennel-

thatsheknew everything would come out allright for

hisopportunities, andprepare fortheposition Mr.

hisstudies.
Capt. Gordon hadbeen very successful during the
wargrowing cotton. Prices hadgone very highand
hehadaccumulated quite alittlemoney. Butin1920
cotton prices declined rapidly and hiscotton brought
very little, which again reduced them topoor circum-
stances. Robert became very illagain from malaria
during theSpring andSummer of1920, sothathewas
unable tow^ork even ifhewanted to.Uptothistime
hehadshown noambition foranykind ofwork, except
totrytomake something with hisfather's tools; talk
about inventions andsome ofthegreat things hewas
going todointheyears tocome. Hismother had al-
ways petted himbecause ofhissevere illnesses and
accident, andhisfather often referred tohim ashis
mother's burden orhismother's problem. Butshehad
great faith inyoung Robert because heclung sostrongly
toreligion, believing intheBible. Robert would spend

CHAPTER III
IINtheSpring of1921, Robert began tomake greater
progress inhisstudies, which greatly encouraged
hischum, Walter Kennelworth. Robert would study
andread early and late. Walter would often callon
him inhisroomandfindhimthere deeply engrossed
reading theBible andpuzzling overtheinterpretation
ofthemeaning ofmany parts oftheScriptures.
OneSunday intheearly part ofJune, Robert and
Walter went tochurch andtheminister took forhis
text 1Cor. 13:2, ''And though Ihave thegift of
prophecy, andunderstand allmysteries, and allknowl-
edge;andthough Ihave allfaith, sothatIcouldremove
mountains, andhave notcharity, Iamnothing." Then
theminister readfrom the7th verse, "Beareth all
things, believeth allthings, hopeth allthings, endureth
allthings,'' andagain from the11th verse, ''When I
wasachild, Ispake asachild, Iunderstood asachild,
Ithought asachild ;butwhen Ibecame aman, Iput
away childish things." Theminister further readfrom
the13th verse,"Andnowabideth faith, hope, love, these
three; butthegreatest ofthese islove." Again he
readfrom 2Cor. 5:7,"Forwewalk byfaith, notby
sight," andconcluded thereading ofthetextfrom Gal.
5:14,"For allthelaw isfulfilled inoneword, even in
this,Thou shalt lovethyneighbor asthyself."

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 19
The minister preached agreat sermon. Robert
thought itoneofthebesthehadeverheard andone
which impressed himthemost. Theminister talked
about thegreatwork offaithandsaidthatfaith without
works isdead ;butthatthere could benofaith without
lovebecause lovewasthegreatest ofallthings. That
Godwas love,andthat lovewasthefulfilling ofthe
law,"ForGod soloved theworld thathegave hisonly
begotten sonthatwhomsoever believeth onHimmight
notperish, buthave everlasting life."Headded that
God loves children whohonor andobey their parents,
wiveswho loveandobey their husbands, husbands who
loveandprotect their wives, andadmonished eachman
tolovehisneighbor ashimself. Because love isthelaw
ofharmony, andthepower that created theuniverse,
itistheonlypower thatcanprevent destruction, war
andhuman death, butwith true lovewecanovercome
thelastgreat enemy, death.
Whenmen loveeach other asGod loves them, there
willbenolonger any strife orcontention. Man will
nolonger covetwhat belongs tohisneighbor. True love
willdeal justly anddounto others aswewish tohave
them dounto us.Hepreached about theambitions, the
loveofcountry andpatriotism which inspires men togo
tobattle andgive their lives fortheprotection oftheir
homeandcountry. Hesaid,"Greater lovehathnoman
than this, thathelaydown hislifeforhisfriend,'' and
thatagreat reward wassure tocome tothosewholove
andobeyGod.Hetalked ofGod's greatcommand, "If
youloveme,keepmycommandments."
Thissermon stirred Robert's ambition asnothing else

20 THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
hadeverdone before. Itmadehim realize thelove
thatheowed tohismother, whose great faithandlove
hadhelped tolaythefoundation forhisfuture career.
Hethought about what thepreacher said—thataman
deserts father andmother tocleave unto hiswife, and
that thiswasasitshould be.Hehadalways felthis
greatest loveforhismother, butnowforthe firsttime
inhislifehebegan tothink ofloveforanother woman.
Hismind turned toward themany beautiful girls
thatheused tomeet inSunday School andthosewho
were inhisclass. Robert's chum, Walter, hadalready
hadapuppy love affair inschool with agirlbythe
name ofCaroline Oglethorpe. Robert hadlaughed
atWalter about thisandthought itwas allfoolishness.
Butnowhebegan tothink thatmaybe therewassome-
thingmore tolovethanwhathehadheretofore believed
ittobe.Walter Kennelworth's family being oneof
themost wealthy andprominent inTexarkana, they
were atallthesocial functions, atwhich Robert met all
theyounger setinthe city.
Afewweeks after theminister hadpreached this
sermon oncharity and love,Robert wasinchurch one
morning, and afterSunday School, wastalking with
Caroline Oglethorpe, andwithherwasherchum, Marie
Stanton. Walter introduced Robert toMarie. Marie
wasthedaughter ofawealthy andprominent family.
Her father, Colonel Stanton, hadmade afortune in
building railroads. Hewasnowabiglumberman, and
oneofthemost prominent inTexarkana. Marie was
abeautiful young girlofabout thirteen years ofage
when Robert met her. Shewasofthetrue brunette

type, with glossy black hairanddark eyesthatsparkled
likediamonds.
About thistime, Robert began toread novels andlove
stories andbecame verymuch interested inthem, al-
ways taking strong sides with theheroandbecoming
verymuch agitated andaroused against the villain.
HesawMarie frequently after this, assheattended the
same school asRobert andWalter. Every time that
Robert sawMarie, shelooked more beautiful tohim.
Robert soonbegan tolosesleep thinking about Marie,
and realized that lovewasthegreatest thing inthe
world. Heconfided hissecret tohisfriend, Walter.
Being very bashful, hehadnever saidanything about
hislove toMarie. Finally hemadeuphismind one
night thathewould write herabout it,sothis iswhat
hewrote:
Wednesday Eve.
Dear Marie,
You probably remember several weeks ago,when Iwas
introduced toyou inchurch, thesermon that theminister
preached andhistextfrom St=Paulwhere hesaid,"The great-
estthing intheworld islove." Iagree with St.Paul; that
iswhy Iamwriting toyou.
Ilikedyouthe firsttime Imetyou,andevery time Ihave
seenyou since, Ihave likedyoumore. Now that Iknow I
loveyousomuch, Ifeelthat Imust tellyou. Ihope that
youaregoing tolovemesome day.
Your friend,
Robert.
Marie replied totheletter asfollows:
Dear Robert,
Ireceived your nice note. This isthefirsttime thatanyone
haseverwritten tomeabout loveandIamallexcited over it.

22 THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
Inever thought thatyouliked me,Bobbie. Ialways thought
thatyouweremaking eyes atKitty Anderson inschool. I
dolikeyouandthink thatyouareaniceboy.
Yours,
Marie.
When Robert read the last line, hefelt hisheart
jump rightupinhisthroat. Hishopes andambitions
soared higher than theyhadever before. Hebegan
todream ofthefuture withMarie ashiswife.He
talked ofhisplans toWalter, andhishope ofbeing a
great inventor some dayandmaking alotofmoney
sothathecould marry awealthy girl likeMarie.
Thefollowing Sunday, hewenthome tothecountry
toseehismother, andtoldherthestory ofthenewlove
affair. "Bobbie," said hismother, ^^you arelittle over
fifteen years old,and this isonlypuppy love, orwhat
they callschool-boy and school-girl love. Itwillsoon
passaway, butthere isnoharm init.Love isagreat
thing andsome dayyouwillmeet theright girl, but
there isnousebeing inanyhurry about it."
Bobbie toldhismother thatMarie wastheonly girl
intheworld forhim,andthathewould liveandwork
forher; that ifhecouldn't marry Marie henever
wanted anyother girl. Hismother laughed atthisand
toldhim thatthey allthought thatwayover the first
love affair, butthat after awhile, astheyears wentby
andhemettherealone,thiswould allpassaway. How-
ever, shedid tellBobbie thatshehadnever forgotten
her first love, asthere issomething different about the
first love,even tho itdoesn't last.

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 23
"Stick toyour studies/' said she, ^'and donot let
your loveforMarie interfere withyour progress.''
Shesawthat this lovewasagreat stimulator for
Robert andthat hisambitions were greater than ever.
Hetoldhismother thathewasgoing toSunday School
every Sunday andthathewasstudying hard, reading
theBible andlearning alot,andthathewaspreparing
tobeagreat man. Hismother said, "Bobbie, Ihave
always hadgreat faith inyou,andIknow thatone
daymydream willcome true,andyouwilldosomething
that willmakemeveryproud ofyou.''
InJune, 1921, Robert Gordon andWalter Kennel-
worth were inthegraduating class. Altho Walter
wasoneyearyounger than Robert, hisearly advantages
enabled him tograduate atfourteen, while Robert was
graduating attheageoffifteen, andwould nothave
been abletopass allofhisexaminations except forthe
helpand assistance rendered himbyWalter. Marie
Stanton, whowasthen thirteen years ofage,graduated
thefollowing year.
After Robert graduated, heatfirstdeciaed tosecure
aposition andgotowork, butafter consulting with
Walter, hedecided that itwould bebest toenterHigh
School and getthru assoon aspossible. Sointhe
Fallof1921, heandWalter began High School. Here
iswhere hisgreatest workbegan toshow forth.Hetook
agreat interest inphysics andhigher mathematics,
studied dayandnight, making veryhighmarks inthese
studies. Also took aninterest inchemistry, which
Walter was specializing in,because heknew that it

would beuseful tohimwith hisinvention, which he
was stilltalking somuch about, andhisplans.
Thetime passed byquickly and in1924 Robert
Gordon andWalter Kennelworth graduated fromHigh
School inTexarkana withhigh honors. Inthemean-
time, thelove affair between Robert andMarie had
continued with theusual interruptions, obstacles and
petty quarrels existing between young people oftheir
age.
IntheFallof1924, itwasfinally decided thatWalter
should gotoColumbia College inNewYork tobegin
hiscourse. Robert's parents wereunable tofinance him
through College, and itwasdecided thatheshould go
towork forMr.Kennelworth inhisoffice. Robert hated
topartwith hisoldfriend, Walter, buttheythought it
wasforthebestandtalked ofthefuture inNewYork,
hoping thatonedayRobert could joinWalter there.
Inthefollowing year, 1925, Marie Stanton graduated
fromHigh School with thehighest ofhonors. Robert
was atthegraduation exercises andthought thatMarie
hadgrown more beautiful every year,andwasanxious
fortheday tocomewhen hecould claim herforhis
wife. Soon after hergraduation fromHigh School,
there wasmuch talkabout theCollege Marie should
enter. Herfather andmother finally decided thatshe
should gototheKidd-Key College atSherman, Texas,
asthiswasnearby andMarie could gohome occa-
sionally.
Asthetimeneared forMarie togoaway, Robert be-
camemore anxious. Hethought Marie would fallin
lovewithsomeone else.Hetalked with herabout the

future, andforthe first time, spoke ofmarriage. He
talked toherofthedifference intheir station inlife,
andsaid that hismother thought that amarriage be-
tween awealthy girlandboyofpoor circumstances
could never result inharmony andhappiness. Hetold
Marie thestory thattheolddarky hadrelated onthe
fishing trip,about thelove affair between thepoorcoun-
tryboyandthewealthy planter's daughter, andtheir
tragic death. Marie thought herfather would never
consent totheir marriage, butshesaidshereally loved
Robert andwhen thetime came, shewould elope with
him ifnecessary. This greatly cheered Robert and
made iteasier forhimafterMarie wentaway toCollege.
Love letters passed between them during thefirstyear
shewasatcollege, and allwent well. Robert worked
hard inhisnew position inMr.Kennelworth's office.
Hewasawilling worker, anexpert stenographer and
secretary. Robert continued toshow expert mechanical
ability andcould fixanything thatwaswrong withan
automobile.
Walter corresponded often withRobert andalsowrote
tohisfather asking howRobert was getting along.
Mr.Kennelworth replied thatRobert wasmaking great
progress, thathewasavery brilliant boyandhewas
going tohelphim allhecould forhethought Robert
hadagreat future.
1926wastobeoneofthemost eventful years inthe
lifeofRobert Gordon. IntheSpring hisfather died
suddenly, andafter aconsultation with hismother, it
wasdecided thatheshould leave hisposition, return
tothefarm andhelpthem togetthings straightened

out.Heencountered theusual obstacles andopposition
from hisbrother, because heknew nothing about farm-
ingandofcourse didnotlike it.The result wasthat
heput allofhissavings intohelping tomake thecrop.
While itturned outtobeagood crop, thelowprices
ofcotton intheFall of1926 leftthem indebt.
While onthefarm, hecontracted malaria fever and
asevere spell ofillness followed, during which timehe
received many consoling letters from Marie. Soon
after hewas able toreturn tohisposition withMr.
Kennelworth, hemetwith another severe automobile
accident, thistimebreaking hisright arm. This neces-
sitated sixweeks inthehospital before hewasable to
return towork again. Onedisappointment followed
another, butRobert hadlearned topractice patience.
HereadtheBible, especially thestory ofJob,continued
togotochurch, andwhile hewassuffering many trials
and tribulations, hismind wasexpanding. Hecould
notaccept thetheory preached andtaught bypreachers,
because heknew that thethings they taught were
wrong.
Marie returned home forhervacation. Shewasnow
eighteen years old,andhadgrown more beautiful and
began toattract more attention from young men.As
theKennelworths andStantons hadbeen friends for
years, Walter suggested tohisparents thatthey give a
party inhonor ofMarie Stanton. Ayoungmanbythe
name ofEdward Mason, thesonofavery wealthy
northern family, was there, andshowed marked atten-
tion toMarie. Robert became very jealous andafter
theparty hadaquarrel with her.Then followed long

This istobemyfarewell letter toyou. Iquote from Solo-
mon, 2:5,"Stay mewith flagons, comfort mewith apples;

apples andastomach-ache, likeSolomon says, forIamsick
ofwhat you call love. Iwant you toread St.Paul again,
andseeifthewayyouareacting istheway love acts. Paul
says that"Love suffereth long, and iskind; loveenvieth not,
doth notbehave itself unseemly, seeketh notherown, isnot
easily provoked, thinketh noevil." Robert, iflove isfounded
onfaithand trust, itcannot bejealous. Love isthefounda-

WHE^NiRobert received Marie's letter, hebegan
toseehimself inadifferent light. Heread
again theBook ofJob,andrealized what Jobmeant
when hesaid, "Ihadagreat fear,and ithascomeupon
me." Robert realized thathehadbeen fearful oflosing
Marie, andthatassoon asthere seemed tobeapossibil-

hadcomeuponhimandcaused him tobecome jealous
without cause, andthathehad lostorwasabout tolose,
Marie, whohadbeenmore than lifetohim. Sohere-
plied toMarie asfollows:
Dearest Maeie:
Yonr sweet letter received. Ithasopened myheart to
understanding andmademeseemyself asIam. Ihave read
St.Paul onthegreatest thing intheworld and find that I
have notbeen patient, have notbeenkind orgenerous. Above
all,Ihave been jealous without cause. Allofthese things
arenotapart oftrue love. Paul says, "Faith, Hope and
Love, butthegreatest ofthese isLove." IfIhadhadthat
great faith which never faileth andwhich isfounded onlove
Iwould nothave been jealous. Ihave been selfish; have
sought myself toplease, andhave notthought enough about
you.

while there really isonlyoneperfect gate. Imagination often
leads usinto thewrong path.
selfishness
We enter thru thegate ofSelfishness andimmediately
find ourselves inthedark Valley ofDoubt where thefoul
weeds ofdeceit, lackofconfidence, malice, greed andjealousy
abound. Justontheother sideoftheValley ofDoubt lies
theMountain ofJealousy, which springs from lack offaith,
understanding and forgetfulness. From theMountain of
Jealousy flows theriver ofHate which has itssource inthe
Valley ofDoubt. This river leads totheSeaofUnhappiness,
Sorrow, Despair andDeath.
unselfishness
Wenow enter theright gate totheGarden ofLove, where
weseeagolden sign "Unselfishness" which canonly lead to
Love.Weenter theGarden thru theGate ofUnderstand-
ingwhere abeautiful bedofwhite liliesgrow inalltheir

Nextyou will seeafountain ofpure water. Touch your
lipstoitfor itistheWater ofForgetfulness and itfeeds the
Lily ofFaith. After thisyou areready topassonthru
theGarden andenjoy theflowers which blossom forth nur-
tured bytheWater ofLove. Among these areSelf-sacrifice,
which isthebasis ofreal love. Thenyouwill findabeautiful
flower thatmany never seeatall,Confidence. Itisbeautiful
andfragrant andstands near theFlower ofHappiness.
You will find theflower ofKindness infullbloom beside
theRose ofCharity, then near theendoftheGarden there
isatiny flower blooming allalone. Itispaleand delicate

itisUnrewarded
Kindness. Butwedoreach itjustbefore wepass into the
Vale ofContent, andwerealize that thepathwhich leads to
Love andHappiness isonlyfound byhelping toleadour
fellow travelers thru theField ofContent.
When wehave progressed thus farwelook fortheother
entrance totheGarden and find that theGate ofSelfishness
hasdisappeared andtheValley ofDoubt isnowcovered with
theLily ofFaith, and theMountain ofJealousy hasbeen
melted intoaValley ofSelf-sacrifice. Where theRiver of
Hate flowed wenow findaSeaofKindness flowing into the
Ocean ofHappiness. When wereach theendoftheGarden

CHAPTER V
MARIE'S loveanddevotion forRobert v^ere bear-
ingfruit. Hestudied theBible dayandnight,
worked onhisplans forthefuture andcontinued his
investigation ofscience, forhebelieved thattheBible
wasthekeytotheprocess bywhichmanmayknow all
there istoknow. Herealized thatbystudying ithe
might beable toforecast thefuture andbenefit himself
thereby. Above allthings hewas interested inair-
planes, inventing andimproving anairplane thatwould
beuseful inthefuture wars.Hehadfound theplan
foragreat airplane inEzekiel 1:4:-16:
And Ilooked, and behold, awhirlwind came outofthe
north, agreat cloud, andafireinfolding itself, andabright-
nesswasabout it,andoutofthemidst thereof asthecolour
ofamber, outofthemidst ofthe fire.
Also outofthemidst thereof came thelikeness offour
living creatures. And thiswas their appearance; theyhad
thelikeness ofaman.
Andonehadfour faces, andevery onehadfour wings.
And their feetwere straight feet; and thesole oftheir
feetwas likethesoleofacalf's foot; andthey sparkled like
thecolour ofburnished brass.
And theyhadthehands ofamanunder their wings on
their four sides ;andtheyfourhadtheir facesandtheir wings.
Their wings were joined one toanother; they turned not
when they went; theywent every onestraight forward.
Asforthelikeness oftheir faces, they fourhadtheface


=== PAGE BREAK ===

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 51
ofaman,andthefaceofalionontheright side; andthey
fourhadtheface ofanoxontheleft side; they four also
hadthefaceofaneagle.
Thus were their faces; and their wings were stretched up-
ward; twowings ofevery onewere joined onetoanother;
andtwocovered their bodies.
And theywent every onestraight forward; whither the
spirit was togo;theywent; andtheyturned notwhen they
went.
Asforthelikeness oftheliving creatures, theirappearance
was likeburning coals offire,and liketheappearance of
lamps :itwentupanddownamong theliving creatures ;and
the firewas bright, andoutofthe firewent forth lightning.
And theliving creatures ranandreturned astheappear-
ance ofaflash oflightning.
Now, asIbeheld theliving creatures, behold, onewheel
upon theearth bytheliving creatures, with hisfour faces.
Theappearance ofthewheels and their work was like
unto thecolour ofaberyl; andtheyfourhadonelikeness:
andtheir appearance and theirworkwasasitwere awheel
inthemiddle ofawheel.
Robert feltsure that thiswastheprediction andde-
scription ofanairplane thatEzekiel wastalking about.
Hethought thatanairplane could bebuilt with four
wings, which would bemore powerful anduseful than
anyoftheairplanes yetbuilt. Itwashisgreat desire
tobuild anairplane ofthiskind.
Robert read Ezekiel 5:2and12:
Thou shaltburn with fireathird part inthemidst ofthe
city,when thedays ofthesiege arefulfilled; andthou shalt
takeathird part,andsmite about itwithaknife ;andathird
partthou shalt scatter inthewind; andIwilldraw buta
sword after them.
Athird part ofthee shall diewith thepestilence, andwith

famine shall theybeconsumed inthemidst ofthee; anda
third part shall fallbythesword round about thee; and I
will scatter athird part into allthewinds, andIwilldraw
outasword after them.
AlsoEzekiel 7:2and12:
Also, thou sonofman, thus saith theLordGodunto the
land ofIsrael. Anend,theend iscomeupon thefourcomers
oftheland.
Thetime iscome, thedaydraweth near; letnotthebuyer
rejoice, northeseller mourn; forwrath isupon allthemul-
titude thereof.
Robert thought liesawinthisthecoming warand
famine ontheearth from the cycle, that agreater
portion oftheearth would bedestroyed bywarand
famine, andthattheendwasnear. Ezekiel 7:13:
Fortheseller shall notreturn tothatwhich issold,although
theywere yetalive; forthevision istouching thewhole mul-
titude thereof, which shall notreturn; neither shall any
strengthen himself intheiniquity ofhis life.
Ezekiel 8:1and14:
And itcame topass inthesixth year, inthesixth month,
inthe fifthdayofthemonth, asIsatinmine house, and
theelders ofJudah satbefore me,that thehand oftheLord
God fellthereupon me.
Then hebrought metothedoor ofthegate oftheLord's
house which wastoward thenorth; and behold, there sat
women weeping forTammuz.
Ezekiel 10:9-11:
Andwhen Ilooked, behold, thefour wheels bythecheru-
bims, onewheel byonecherub, andanother wheel byanother

cherub: andtheappearance ofthewheels was asofthe
colour ofaberyl stone.
And asfortheir appearances, they fourhadonelikeness,
asifawheel hadbeen inthemidst ofawheel.
When they went, theywent upon their four sides; they
turned notasthey went, buttotheplace whither thehead
looked they followed it;theyturned notasthey went.
Robert feltsurethat itwasanairplane which Ezekiel
wastalking about andwhich wasgoing tobemade in
thefuture. Hethought theonereferred towith ^'the
faceofaneagle" referred totheUnited States Govern-
ment. Hehoped tobuild some dayandhelpwinthe
greatwar intheairandmake peacewhen thedays of
the"End" come andthegreat airbattles would be
fought. Ezekiel 10:19 and21:
And thecherubims lifted uptheir wings, andmounted up
from theearth inmysight; when theywent out,thewheels
alsowere beside them; andevery onestood atthedoor of
theeastgate oftheLord's house; andtheglory oftheGod
ofIsrael wasoverthem above.
Every onehadfour faces apiece, andevery onefourwings;
andthelikeness ofthehands ofamanwasunder their wings.
Ezekiel 12:22:
Sonofman,what isthatproverb thatyehave intheland
ofIsrael, saying, Thedays areprolonged, andevery vision
faileth?
Ezekiel 14:14, 16and21:
Though these three men, Noah, Daniel andJob,were init,

Behold, every onethat useth proverbs shall usethisprov-

Ezekiel 17:3and7:
And say.Thus saith theLord God,Agreat eagle with great
wings, long-winged, fulloffeathers, which haddivers colours,
came untoLebanon, andtook thehighest branch ofthecedar:
There was alsoanother great eagle with great wings and
many feathers; and, behold, this vine didbend herroots
toward him,and shot forth herbranches toward him, that
hemight water itbythefurrows ofherplantation.
Ezekiel 20:46:
Sonofman setthyfacetoward thesouth, anddrop thy
word toward thesouth, andprophesy against theforest of
thesouth field:
Robert interpreted this tomean that thedaywas
coming when therewould beagreat airfightfrom the
southern part oftheUnited States. Ezekiel 20:47:
And saytotheforest ofthesouth, Hear theword ofthe
Lord, Thus saith theLord God, Behold, Iwillkindle afire
inthee, and itshall devour every green tree inthee, and
every drytree; theflaming flame shall notbequenched, and

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 55
Hethought thismeant theSouth would bedestroyed
byairplanes with liquid fireandpoisonous chemicals
when thewarwould take place.
Robert read Ezekiel 21:14, 26and30:
Thou, therefore, sonofman, prophesy, andsmite thine
hands together, and letthesword bedoubled thethird time,
thesword oftheslain; itisthesword ofthegreatmen that

andabase him that ishigh.
Shall Icause ittoreturn into hissheath? Iwilljudge
thee intheplace where thou wast created, intheland of

Ezekiel 28:3:
Behold thou artwiser than Daniel; there isnosecret that
theycanhidefrom thee:
Robert hadgreat faith intheprophecies ofEzekiel
because theLord said: ^'Behold, thou artwiser than
Daniel. There isnosecret thatthey canhidefrom
thee." Heunderstood from Ezekiel's prophecies that
agreatwarwascoming andthat itwould befought in
theairbythegreat airplanes asdescribed byEzekiel
32:1and2:
And itcame topass inthetwelfth year, inthetwelfth
month, inthe firstdayofthemonth, that theword ofthe
Lordcame unto me,saying.
Sonofman, takeupalamentation forPharaoh king of
Lgypt, andsayunto him.Thou artlikeayoung lionofthe

earnest forth with thy rivers, andtroubledst thewaters with
thyfeet,andfouledst their rivers.

From these predictions ofEzekiel andothers inthe
Bible which Robert believed wasarepetition ofpre-
vious battles, heinterpreted ittomean thatthere was
tobeagreat floodduring theyear 1927.Hepredicted
terrible floods along theMississippi Valley, which would
destroy thecotton crops andwould laywaste vast acres
offertile land.Hewrote that itwould beoneofthe
greatest floods inhistory. Ezekiel 32:7:
Andwhen Ishallputthee out,Iwillcover theheaven, and
make thestars thereof dark; Iwill cover thesunwith a
cloud, andthemoon shall notgiveher light.
Robert understood thistomean thetwogreat eclipses
thatwould occur inJune, 1927.
Ezekiel 33:21 and33:
And itcame topass inthetwelfth year ofourcaptivity,
inthetenth month, inthe fifthdayofthemonth, thatone
thathadescaped outofJerusalem came untome,saying. The
City issmitten.
Andwhen thiscometh topass, (lo, itwillcome) then shall
theyknow that aprophet hathbeenamong them.
Robert feltthatheknew theScriptures andwaspre-
pared toprophesy thefuture andwarn thepeople of
thefamine, pestilence andthecoming war.
Ezekiel 35:1and8:
Moreover, theword oftheLordcame unto me,saying.
And Iwill fillhismountains with hisslainmen: inthy
hills, and inthy valleys, and inallthy rivers, shall they
fallthat areslain with thesword.
Ezekiel 36:1and34:
Also, thou sonofman, prophesy unto themountains of

Israel, andsay,Yemountains ofIsrael, hear theword ofthe
Lord.
And thedesolate land shall betilled, whereas itlaydeso-
lateinthesight ofallthatpassed by.
Ezekiel 37:9, 16,17,19and22:
Then saidheuntome,Prophesy unto thewind, prophesy, son
ofman,andsaytothewind, Thus saith theLord God,Come
from thefour winds, Breath, andbreathe upon these slain,
thattheymay live.
Moreover, thou sonofman, take theeone stick, andwrite
upon it.ForJudah, andforthechildren ofIsrael hiscom-
panions: then take another stick and write upon it.For
Joseph, thestick ofEphraim, andfor allthehouse ofIsrael
hiscompanions:
And jointhem onetoanother intoonestick; andthey shall
become oneinthine hand.
Sayunto them. Thus saith theLord God, Behold, Iwill
take thestick ofJoseph, which isinthehand ofEphraim,
andthetribes ofIsrael hisfellows, and willputthem with
him,evenwith thestick ofJudah, andmake them one stick,
andthey shall beoneinmine hand.
And Iwillmakethem onenation inthelandupon themoun-
tains ofIsrael; andoneking shall beking tothem all;and
they shall benomore two nations, neither shall they be
divided intotwokingdoms, anymore atall.
Robert interpreted this tomean thecoming ofthe
great warwhen theUnited States should betheone
great nation thatwould rule theworld; that there
would benomore divided kingdoms andnomore di-
vided countries, that itwould betheUnited States of
theWorld, which would betheland ofliberty where
freedom exists.

Ezekiel 38:19:
For inmyjealousy and inthe fireofmywrath, have I
spoken, Surely inthatdaythere shall beagreat shaking in
theland ofIsrael.
Robert understood—"the jealousy inthe fire of
wrath''—tomean chemical elements which would be
used inthecoming warandtheuseofairplanes.
Ezekiel 39:2:
And Iwillturn theeback, andleave butthesixth part of
thee,andwillcause thee tocomeupfrom thenorth parts, and
willbring theeupon themountains ofIsrael.
Robert's interpretation ofthiswasthatthelastgreat
battle ofthewarwas tobefought inthenorthern
part oftheUnited States.
Ezekiel 39:8and9:
Behold, itiscome, and itisdone, saith theLordGod; this
isthedaywhereof Ihave spoken.
And they that dwell inthe cities ofIsrael shall goforth,
and shall setonfireandburn theweapons, both theshields
andthebucklers, thebowsandthearrows, andthehandstaves
andthespears, andthey shallburnthem with fireseven years.
Hethought the9thverse where itsays that every-
thing should beburnt with fireseven years, meant
either seven years ofwar, orseven days.Hehadread
where itsays, "Iwillappoint adayforayearanda
year foraday."
Ezekiel 39:11, 12and14:
And itshallcome topass inthatday, that Iwillgiveunto
Gogaplace there ofgraves inIsrael, thevalley ofthepas-

them, thattheymay cleanse theland.
And they shall sever outmen ofcontinual employment,
passing through theland tobury with thepassengers those

theendofseven months shall they search.
Robert thought allthisreferred tothewar yetto
come, inwhich theUnited States was toplay thefinal
andprincipal part,andtheuseoftheairplanes should
reach itsgreatest perfection.
Ezekiel 43:1, 2,3,4and10:

CHAPTER YI
ROBERT wrote toWalter in'NewYork andtold
him about hisplans forthefuture; how well
hewasgetting along, about hisnewdiscoveries andhow
hehadworked outthefuture from theBible. Heasked
Walter's advice about sending anarticle toWalter's
father inregard tohisfuture predictions based onthe
Bible. Walter thought ittheopportune time, inview
ofthefactthathisfather hadconfidence inRobert.
After hehadworked outhiscycle theory according
totheBible, anddecided thathecould forecast the
markets andmake money, hewrote toMr.Kennelworth,
hisemployer.
Texarkana, Texas.
January 15,1927.
Mr. J.H.Kennelworth,
Texarkana,
Texas.
MydearMr.Kennelworth:
Iwantyou toknowhowmuch Iappreciate thebonus you
gavemeonthe1stoftheyear. While Iwant touse itwisely,
together with alittle othermoney Ihave saved, Ifeel itis
myduty totellyouwhat Iintend todowith it.
Ihave been studying theBible night anddayformany
years, and Ibelieve that Ihave found initthekey toall
prophecy,—therules fortelling theevents inthehistory of
thecountry, theprogress ininvention, andalsorules forfore-
casting thefuture ofstocks andcommodities. Ihave been


=== PAGE BREAK ===

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 63
reading some books andstudj'ing commodities andstocks and
have applied therules asIunderstand themfrom theBible.
Ifeelsure that Iamable toforetell what isgoing tohappen
instocks andcommodities, and Iamvery anxious tomake
somemoney outofitsothat IcangotoNev;^York andjoin
Walter there, where Iwillhave greater advantages andcan
study andexperiment withsome inventions which Ihave in
mind.
From theteachings oftheBible andthemethods which I
haveworked out, Ifeelconfident that theprice ofcotton is
going very high thisSpring. Ifigure that there aregoing to
besome heavy floods along theMississippi River, andthat
there willbealate,wetSpring, andthat thedemand forcot-
tonwill greatly increase, helping toput prices very high.
Therefore, Ihave decided tousethe$500.00 which yougave
meandanother $500.00 which Ihave saved up,tobuycotton
tohold fortheSpring andSummer. Iwould like tohave
your opinion ofthisventure.
Assuring youofmyappreciation ofyour advice, Iam
Sincerely yours,
Robert Gordon.
About thistimeMr. J.11.Kennelwortli received tlie
following letter from hisson,Walter, inISTewYork:
NewYork City,
January 12,1927.
Dear Father:
Ihave justreceived aletter frommygood friend, Robert,
andhetellsmethatheisanxious tojoinmeinNewYork in
afewmonths, thathehasfigured outsomenew discoveries
andinventions from theBible, andthathewants todosome
speculating inorder tomake some money. Heaskedmy
opinion ofputting before yousome ofhisdiscoveries and
getting your opinion onthem. Iwrote himthat Iwassure
hewould findasympathetic listener inyouandadvised him
toputhisplans frankly before you.

Father, Ihope thatyou willgiveRobert your best advice
andco-operation because Ihave great faith inhim.He is
abrilliant boyand isgoing tohave agreat future. He is
loyal andhonest, youknow, andahard worker, andIwould
hate toseehimleave your employ. Atthesame time Iwould
liketoseehiminNewYork assoon aspossible.
Iamgetting along nicely withmystudies, andhope to
graduate inacouple ofyears.
Givemylove tomother, and all.
Your son,
Walter.
When Mr.Kennelworth received Robert's letter, he
dictated thefollowing reply tohisstenographer:
MydearRobert :
Your very interesting letter received. Ihave thegreatest
faith inyour ability andbelieve that ifanyone canwork out
anything valuable from theBible, youcando it. Ihave
watched very carefully your persistency, andammuch im-
pressed withyour loj^alty anddetermination. Itisadmirable
theconfidence and faith thatyouhave inyourself, aswell
ashaving great confidence inthegreatest book ofall.The
Holy Bible.
Butwhen itcomes tospeculation, Robert, Iwant togive
yousome advice frommyexperience. Itisaverydangerous
game. Itmaybeinviting, but itisnotabusiness, Robert. It
isagamble. Ofcourse Iknow thatsomemenmake ita
business. Mostmencannot control themselves when they get
into it,theresult—theygamble, andintheend, lose all.
Iwillgiveyoualittle experience that Ihad. Iwent to
NewYorkmany years ago,andonadvice andinformation
from some friends ofmine, wasinduced tobuysome oil
stock. Thiswas intheFall of1919. Oilstocks advanced
rapidly, andalong inOctober, myfriends advised metobuy
more. Ihadsome handsome profits anddidbuymore. I
confess that Iknew nothing about oilstocks oranyother


=== PAGE BREAK ===

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 65
stocks, butsimply followed myfriends^ advice inbuying them.
InNovember, 1919, themarket smashed alltopieces, andthe
oilstocks declined 50to100points. Ihadbigprofits atthe
top,butbefore thebreak was over, Inotonly lost allofmy
profits, butabout $50,000 or$60,000 ofmycapital.
This taught mealesson. Ihadmademymoney inthe
lumber business and inrailroading. Ihadnowgone into
something that Iknew nothing about and suffered aheavy
loss.Myfriends andbrokers tried toinduce metoholdon
andputupmore margin; said that Iwould eventually come
outallright, butItook thelossandcharged ituptoexperi-
ence.Had Iheldontothese stocks, Iwould have lostmy
entire fortune, because they continued togodown during
1920and1921, andwere 50to60points lower thanwhere I
sold out. Soyoucan see,Robert, what acostly experience
thiswould havebeenandhowwise Iwastostop intime.
Thebestadvice that Icangiveyou is,tostop before you
start. You willsavetimeandworry, aside from thelossof
what littlemoney youhave saved up. Iwant toencourage
andhelpyou ineveryway possible, and Ifeelthat Iam

ascience andfollowed according totlierules laiddown in
theBible, success and profits aresure.
SirWilliam Crookes said: "Tostop short inanyresearch
which bids fair tow^iden thegates ofknowledge, torecoil
from fear ofdifficulties oradverse criticism, istobring re-
proach upon science." Ifeelthat Ihavemyown lifetolive;
that Imust have faith inmyself andabove all,have the
faith which isinstilled inmethrough thestudy oftheBible.
Imust neither fear difficulties nor criticism. Imust putmy
theories andmydiscoveries tothetest. Theonlyway that I
candothat, istofollow what Ithink isright.
Ihave already made arrangements and sentmymoney to
abroker inNew York, andhave today bought 200bales of
July cotton at13.80. Iamgoing tohold this cotton. Ifit
goes up,asIamsure itwill thisSpring andSummer, asmj^
profits accumulate, Iamgoing tobuymore ontheway up.
Ibelieve inwhat theBible says:
^'Prove allthings andhold fast tothatwhich isgood."
Jacob said:
"Ihave read inthetables ofheaven whatsoever things
shall befall both ofyouandyour children."
Ibelieve inthestars, Ibelieve inastrology, andIhave figured
outmydestiny. TheBible makes itplain that thestars do
rule. 147th Psalm, 4thverse:
''He tellest thenumber ofthestars, hecallest them all
byname."
Dante said:
"Follow thystar—thou shalt seeatlastaglorious haven."
ISTapoleon andmany other great leaders ofolden times fol-
lowed their stars, andbelieved inthem.
Mr.Kennelworth, Ihave gained agreat dealofknowledge
byfollowing theBible. Ihave gone into secret places to
pray, andhave keptmydiscoveries tomyself. Ibelieve in
thesaying:


=== PAGE BREAK ===

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 67
^'In silence, bysilence, through silence were allthings
made."
Daniel makes itclear that thestars influence:
"And hechangeth thetimes and theseasons: here-
moveth kings, and setteth upkings: hegiveth wisdom
unto the v/ise, andknowledge tothem thatknow un-
derstanding."
"He revealeth thedeepand secret things: heknoweth
what isinthedarkness, andthelight dwelleth with
him."
Ihave followed theteachings andadmonitions ofSolo-
mon,andrealize thatknowledge isthegreatest ofallthings.
Ihave tried togetunderstanding and believe that Ihave
received itfrom theBible, andthat Imust use it.
Irefer toDaniel:
"And inthedays ofthese kings shall theGodofheaven
setupakingdom which shall never bedestroyed: and
thekingdom shall notbeleft toother people, but it
shall break inpieces andconsume allthese kingdoms,
and itshall stand forever."
Mr.Kennelworth, Ibelieve thisprophesy isyettobeful-
filled. Ibelieve that theUnited States isthekingdom which
isnever tobedestroyed; thatwewill eventually seethe
United States oftheWorld, andthat thiscountry, which is
theland ofloveand liberty, willrulewisely allother nations.
Iquote from Daniel:
"And whereas theycommanded toleave thestump of
thetree roots; thykingdom shall besureunto thee,
after thatthou shalt haveknown that theheavens do
rule."
Ihave demonstrated this tomean that theplanets ruleour
destinies. Itisright forustounderstand them asDaniel did
andinterpret thesecret andhidden things.
Ibelieve thewisemen oftheEast, theastrologists before
thebirth ofJesus Christ, knew where andwhen hewould be
bombythestudy ofthestars. St.Matthew, Chapter 2:2—


=== PAGE BREAK ===

68 THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
"Saying, Where ishethat isbomKing oftheJews?
forwehave seen hisstar inthe east,andarecome
toworship him."
Thisshows tomethatthewisemenbelieved that certain stars
arising would indicate agreatmanwould beborn, asavior
oftheworld. St.Matthew, Chapter 6:6and8—
"But thou,when thou prayest, enter intothy closet, and
when thou hast shut thedoor, pray tothyFather,
which isinsecret; andthyFather, which seeth in
secret, shall reward theeopenly."
^'Benotyetherefore likeunto them: foryour Father
knoweth what things yehave need ofbefore yeask
him."
Ihaveprayed andstudied insecret, andIbelieve Iamgoing
toreceive myreward. Ibelieve that ourheavenly Father,
theruler andmaker ofthis universe, doesknow ourneeds,
andthathegives usunderstanding according tothewaywe
would receive it.
Iwasmuch impressed when Iread St.Matthew 6;33—
"But seekyefirstthekingdom ofGod,andhisrighteous-
ness; and allthese things shall beadded unto you."
Ihave sought thatkingdom and Ihave found itwhere the
goodbook says itis :"Thekingdom ofheaven iswithin you."
Again thegoodbook says:
"Ifyebelieve inme,greater things than these shall
yedo."
Ibelieve thatIcanandwilldogreat things.
Ever since Iwasasmall boy,andused tokneel atmy
mother's knee, andshetaught mefirsttopray, Ihave believed
inthatgreat bookandinGod's power toguidemeright and
givemeunderstanding ofallthings. Myown father never
understood meorhadanysympathy withmeormyideas,
which Ifeelwere faradvanced. Myown brother wasmy
worst enemy, andIfindthat theBible bearsmeoutinthis
"And aman^s foes shall betheyofhisownhousehold."


=== PAGE BREAK ===

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 69
Myfather andbrother opposed mebecause they didnotun-
derstand me.
Ifirmly believe that theBible andtheScriptures contain
thekey toallknowledge, andthat allamanhastodoisto
seekandheshall find,knock and itshall beopened unto him.
Ibelieve itisbestformetogoaway toNewYork assoon
asIcan,awayfrommyown people, forthegoodbook says:
"Aprophet isnotwithout honor, save inhisowncoun-
try,andinhisownhouse."
TheBible points theway toread thesigns andthestars.
St.Matthew 12:38,39and40—
"Then certain ofthescribes andPharisees answered,
saying, Master, wewould seeasignfrom thee."
''But heanswered and said unto them,An eviland
adulterous generation seeketh after asign; and there
shallnosignbegiven toit,butthesignoftheprophet
Jonas;"
''For asJonas was three daysandthree nights inthe
whale's belly; soshall theSonofman bethree days
andthree nights intheheart oftheearth."
Ihave read theBook ofJonah thruvery carefully, andI
believe that Iunderstand what theSaviour meant when he
said:
''No sign shall begiven, butthesign oftheprophet
Jonas."
Ibelieve there wasasecret meaning inwhat hesaid; that
theSonofmanbethree daysandthree nights intheheart
oftheearth. Ibelieve thatamanwhounderstands themean-
ingofthathas allthepower under heaven andearth, asthe
Bible saysheshall have. Ibelieve that that isthekeyto

prices forecast coming wars. Through mystudy oftheBible,
Ihave determined themajor andminor time factors which

andthattheUnited States willbeingreat jeopardy, butwill
finally win out. Soyou see,myobject inspeculating isnot
aselfish motive altogether, buttohelp others and tohelp
mycountry.
Thefollowing verses show thatEzekiel waspredicting some-
thing tohappen inthefuture andwascarrying outGod's
instructions. Ezekiel 13 :2and3—
*'Son ofman, prophesy against theprophets ofIsrael
thatprophesy, andsaythou untothem thatprophesy
outoftheirown hearts, Hear yetheword oftheLord";
Ezekiel 14:14,16,18and21—
"Though these three men, Noah, Daniel andJob,were
init,they should deliver buttheirown soulsbytheir
righteousness, saith theLord God."
"Though these threemenwere init,asIlive, saith the
Lord God, they shall deliver neither sons nordaugh-
ters; they only shall bedelivered, buttheland shall
bedesolate."
"Though these threemenwere init,asIlive, saith the
Lord God, they shall deliver neither sonsnordaugh-
ters, butthey only shall bedelivered themselves."
"For thus saith theLord God,Howmuch morewhen I
sendmyfour sorejudgments upon Jerusalem, the
sword, andthefamine, andthenoisome beast, andthe
pestilence, tocut offfrom itmanandbeast?"
Ezekiel 17:3—
"And say,thus saith theLord God,Agreat eagle with
great wings, long-winged, fulloffeathers, which had
divers colours, came untoLebanon, andtook thehighest
branch ofthecedar":
Ezekiel 21 :30—
"Shall Icause ittoreturn unto hissheath? Iwill
judge thee intheplace where thouwast created, inthe
land ofthynativity."
From this, Ibelieve thatmore famines, earthquakes, pesti-
Uence andwars areyettocome andthat thenoisome beast

When Istated that Ibelieved Ezekiel thegreatest prophet

^'Behold, thou artwiser than Daniel. There isnosecret

Daniel wasknown tobeagreat prophet and astrologer. In

CHAPTER VII
Future Cycles
January 28,1927.
IKmaking mypredictions Iusegeometry andmathe-
matics, just astheastronomer does, based on
immutable laws.
Iamabeliever intheBible. Itisthemostwonder-
fulbook everwritten, abook ofscience, philosophy and
religion. Iclaim that allscientific laws arelaiddown
intheBible ifaperson knows where tofindthem.
Refer toSt.Matthew 7:7,which says:
"Ask and itshall begiven you, seekandyeshall find,
knock and itshall beopened unto you."
1hold thattheBible contains thekeytotheprocess by
whichmanmayknow allthere istoknow ofthefuture,
ifhewillonly seek diligently fortherules laiddown
intheHoly Book.
Mycalculations arebased onthecycle theory andon
mathematical sequences. History repeats itself. That
isw^hat Ihave always contended,—that inorder to
know andpredict thefuture ofanything youonlyhave
tolookupwhat hashappened inthepastandgetacor-
rectbase orstarting point.Myauthority forstating
thatthefuture isbutarepetition ofthepast isfound
intheBible.

Read Eccl. 1:9:
"The thing thathath been, itisthatwhich shall be;
and thatwhich isdone, isthatwhich shall bedone:
andthere isnonewthing under thesun."
Again
"That which hasbeen isnowandthatwhich istobe
hath already been."
Thismakes itplain thateverything works according to
past cycles, andthat history repeats itself inthelives
ofmen, nations andthestock market.
Wearetoldthatthegreat continent ofAtlantis, for
centuries submerged under theAtlantic Ocean, pos-
sessed acivilization greater than ours oftoday. The
people ofAtlantis hadtheir telephones, wireless, radios
and airplanes. There isconsiderable truth inthat
statement. According tomathematical sequence, the
wonderful inventions thatbrought comfort andconven-
ience totheAtlantians aredue toappear again, and
wearenowonlyonthethreshold ofanother great age.
Remember, everything inthisuniverse iselliptical
orcircular inmotion; that applies both totheabstract
andtheconcrete, themental, physical and spiritual.
Every thought youthink makes acircle, and itcomes
back toyou. Itmay take years butyouwill getthe
effects, good orevil,according asthethought waseither
good orevil. That isatruthweshould learn, andthe
world willbethebetter for it.
Inmaking mycalculations onthestock market, or
anyfuture event, Igetthepast history and findout
what cycleweareinandthen predict thecurve forthe

future, which isarepetition ofpastmarket movements.
Thegreat lawofvibration isbased onlikeproducing
like. Like causes produce like effects. Wireless teleg-
raphy, thephonograph andtheradio arebased onthis
law. The limit offuture predictions based onexact
mathematical law isonly restricted bylackofknowledge
ofcorrect dataonpast history towork from. Itis
just aseasy tofigure 100years or1000 years inthe
future asoneortwoyears ahead^ ifyouhave thecorrect
starting point andknow thecyclewhich isgoing tobe
repeated.
Afewyears agoeven scientific men, notalone the
public, would havelaughed atsuchathing andrefused
tobelieve it.Butmathematical science, which isthe
only real science that theentire civilized world has
agreed upon, furnishes unmistakable proof ofhistory
repeating itselfandshows thatthecycle theory, orhar-
monic analysis, istheonlything thatwecanrelyupon
toascertain thefuture.
Sometime agoanarticle appeared intheNewYork
American commenting onthewritings ofSirArthur
Evans, foremost English archeologist, who published
*The Palace ofMinos," abook concerning theancient
City ofMinotaur. Hedescribed theexcavation onthe
IsleofCrete intheMediterranean Sea, inwhich they
found modern apartment houses, bath tubsand corsets,

ofyears. Itisestimated thattheancient citywas de-

became popular again isanother proof ofhistory repeat-
ingitself andshows
"There isnonew tiling under thesun,"
butthatwesimply resurrect theoldones.
^^How doIforecast future cycles ?"youmay ask.
Inorder toforecast future cycles, themost important
thing istobegin right, forifwehave theright begin-
ning,wewill gettheright ending. Ifweknow the
cause ofthe effect, then there canbenodoubt about
predicting thefuture event oreffect.
Ihave always looked forcauses andwhen once I
determine acause Icanalways besure ofthe effect
orfuture event which Ipredict. ITIS'NOTMY
AIMTOEXPLAIN" THECAUSE OFCYCLES.
Thegeneral public isnotyetready for itandprobably
would notunderstand orbelieve itifIexplained it.
Inevery lawofnature there isamajor andaminor;
apositive, anegative, andaneutral. Therefore, in
cycles theremust bealesser, agreater andintermediate
cycle, orcycles within cycles. Like Ezekiel says:
"Wheel within awheel."
Time isthegreat factor thatproves allthings. The
measurement oftime first originated and isbased on
theearth's motion upon itsaxis. Oneofthesmallest
cycles, ortime factors, which repeats regularly inthings
that arevery active andhave ahigh vibration, isthe
four-minute cycle. Thereason forthis isthattheearth
moves onedegree every four minutes. Thenext cycle
is24hours, thecomplete time required fortheearth
tomake onerevolution upon itsaxis. That ishowman


=== PAGE BREAK ===

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 79
measured hiscycle ofaday.Thenextimportant cycle
isoneyear, thetime required fortheearth tomove
around thesun. This brings about thefour seasons
oftheyear. These aretheminor cycles.
Themajor cycles runin100and5000 years with
variations based onminor cycles. Inorder tobesure
ofworld events andimportant changes, itisnecessary
togoback atleast1000 years andproveupthecycles.
Wefindample proof ofthe1000-year cycle intheBible:
"A little one shallbecome athousand andasmall one
astrong nation; ItheLord, willhasten itinhistime."
Also
"One day iswith theLord asathousand years, and
athousand years asoneday."
Another evidence ofthe1000-year cycle:
"And helaidholdonthedragon, thatoldserpent, which
istheDevil, andSatan, andbound himathousand
years."
Ifwegoback1000 years, wecanfindample proof
ofhowhistory hasbeen repeating itself inthepastfew
years. From about a.d.916to923Europe went thru
about thesame conditions that prevailed 1000 years
later oraround 1914 to1920. During the firstperiod
referred to,Europe experienced wars, panics andcrop
failures. History shows that in916 agriculture in
theBritish Isleswas atitslowest ebbandthat there
wasgreat scarcity ofwheat andcorn. Veryfewpeople
wereengaged intilling thesoilonaccount ofwars. The


=== PAGE BREAK ===

80 THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
same conditions prevailed 1000 years later in1916and
1917,when thiscountry wascalled ontofurnish food
tostarving Europe andsendmenandmoney tosave
their armies from defeat. In917,Constantinople was
besieged bytheBulgarians andwarcontinued to919.
Weknow thatwarprevailed inTurkey and allover
Europe between 1914 and1919. In923there was
CivilWar inFrance and1000 years later, orin1923,
France again hadhertroubles and isstillhaving them.
Another proof ofthe1000- and2000-year cycle is
evidenced byalecture given byProf.Hans Delbruck
oftheUniversity ofBerlin attheUniversity College of
London, just before theoutbreak oftheWorld War
in1914.Hesaid:
"One ofhis first observations incomparing thephe-
nomena ofthehistory ofwars inthedifferent ages
wasthelikeness between thebattles inwhich theSwiss
conquered Duke Charles theBold, andthebattles in
which theGreeks overcame thePersians. They had in
aninterval of2000 years exactly thesamearmsandthe
same political institutions fighting against each other."
What proof ofthe100-year cycle dowegetfrom 100
years agoofwhat hashappened inthepastfewyears ?
IntheUnited States, between 1814and1822,wehad
crop failures, warandyellow fever, especially from
1819 to1822. In1821 Persia wasvisited with Asiatic
cholera. In1823 cholera broke outinseveral porta
along theMediterranean. During thesame period,
corresponding to100years ago,theUnited States had
theterrible epidemic ofinfluenza andinEurope, Russia
was visited with famine, cholera and allkinds ofdis-


=== PAGE BREAK ===

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 81
eases, killing millions. In1822 there wasafamine
inIreland and100years later theywerewinding up
their troubles andtrying tomake settlement andpeace
withEngland. In1922 China andRussia were both
suffering from famines, another proof ofthe100-year
cycle. Some more important evidence ofthis cycle is
found bygoing back100years inhistory, inwhich we
findthatin1819 the firststeamship crossed theAtlan-
ticOcean. In1919, 100years later, theBritish diri-
gibleR-34made asuccessful flight from Scotland to
Mineola, Long Island.
Where dowefindproof intheBible thatthegreat
WorldWarwascoming ?
Theproof that itispossible tomake predictions of
wars, famines, pestilences andgeneral world events
thousands ofyears inadvance, isplainly substantiated
bytheBible. The great World Warwasprophesied
intheBook ofRevelation.
What proof dowefind intheBible ofwhat events
orconditions willfollow wars? What does theBible
sayofthegreatWorldWarwhich St.John theDivine
foretold intheBook ofRevelation ?
"For nation shall rise against nation, andkingdom
against kingdom ;andthere shallbefamines, and pesti-
lences, andearthquakes indivers places."
Again theBible says:
"Immediately after thetribulation ofthese days shall the
sunbedarkened, andthemoon shall notgive light, and
thestars shall fallfrom heaven, andthepowers ofthe
heavens shall beshaken."


=== PAGE BREAK ===

82 THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
Again, itsays:
"The Lord hath called forafamine; and itshall also
comeupon thelandseven years."
And seven years from theclose oftheWorld War,
Europe hadtheterrible crop failures, strikes, business
depression and calamities, which occurred in1923 to
1926.
Some evidence oflong-range predictions which have
been fulfilled, thathasattracted attention, appeared in
theNew York America/n, January 29,1922. The
article refers toanamazing prophecy ofthetwelfth cen-
turymade byMalachy, apriest, ina.d.1139, inwhich
heforetold accurately thepersonality ofthePapal suc-
cession bymeans ofmottoes andnumbers. Heforetold
thelong struggles which Ireland would have togothru
andtheeventual peace, which hasbeen recently signed.
Hisprophecy onthefuture Pope is~Eo.266. Fides
Intrepida, which means—"Unwavering Paith, un-
shaken belief intheface ofdanger; unfaltering devo-
tion." Tothosewhounderstand numbers,^'266'^re-
vealssome remarkable events thataretofollow theelec-
tion ofthenewPope. Itshows thatwars arenotyet
overandthatEurope willhavetroublesome conditions,
andinfact, theentire world must yetpassthru avery
evilperiod between 1926 and1932. Italsoconfirms
both themajor andminor cycles which indicate that
theyears 1928 and1930 to1932 aretobeyears of
famine, depressing business conditions andpanic, not
only inEurope, butintheUnited States. Themaxi-
mum evilofthegreat 1000-year cycle, which willnot

becompleted until 1932 to1934, willbring serious
troubles totheUnited States. Another badperiod for
theUnited States willbe1940 to1944.
Thequestion arises:—Ifwecanknow thefuture, is
itofvalue tous?Ithasbeen well said :^Torewamed
isforearmed,'' butIprefer tolook totheBible for
authority andproof. When Pharaoh hadhiswonderful
dream, hewent toJoseph tohave itinterpreted. Joseph
said:
"And theseven thinand illfavored kine thatcameup
afterthem areseven years; andtheseven empty years,
blasted with theeast wind, shall beseven years of
famine."
Listen totheadvice Joseph gavehim:
"Letthem gather allthefood ofthose good years that
come, andlayupcorn under thehand ofPharaoh,
and letthem keep food inthe cities. Thepeople
throughout theland should takewarning andprepare
fortheunfavorable years tofollow."
TheBible istheBOOK ofallbooks, and ifweonly
study itandunderstand it,wecangainaproper knowl-
edge ofallthings. Ibelieve ittheduty ofanymanwho
understands science andmathematics and thecycle
theory, andknows what iscoming^ towarn thepeople
inorder that theymay prepare fortrouble ahead.
Many will scoffandlaugh andrefuse tobelieve until
itistoo late. TheBible isfullofreferences where
Godhasgiven ussignsbywhichwemayknow what is
coming, ifwewillonly believe them. Hesays:
"0,yehypocrites, yecandiscern theface ofthesky;

CHAPTER Vin
Cycles ofTeansportation"
THEcoming mode oftransportation willbebyair-
plane andIfeelsure they willbeused inthe
greatwartocome. TheBible tellsusthatEnoch, who
wastheseventh fromAdam—anumber generally re-
ferred toasdivine—^wastranslated toheaven forhis
faith attheageof365years. This event took place
about 3017 b.c. Ibelieve that atthattime theyhad
allmodern inventions andthatEnoch wentupinan
airplane. Thewriter ofthebook, probably nothaving
seenanairplane before andseeing Enoch gointothe
sky,thought thathehadgone toheaven. Wearenow
inthe5000-year cycle, from thetime thatEnoch was
transferred toheaven, and this indicates theprogress
oftheairplane atthistime. Elijah was alsotranslated
toheaven inacloud offire,in896 b.c. Ibelieve this,
too,wasanairplane. Since thechariot wasseenblazing
withsome kind offireorgas,therecorder thought it
wasjustsomething totakeElijah toheaven.
Man firsttraveled byland, thenconquered thewater
and last,thegreatest featofall, isconquering theair,
which wasplainly foretold intheBible.
In1602 there wasarailway built in'New Castle,
England, operated byhorsepower. In1776, the first

iron railswere laid, the firstimportant stepleading to
railways. InJuly, 1801, there wasacompleted tram
roadfrom Croyden toWandsworth, England. In
1802, the first high-pressure locomotive wasinvented.
In1813, William Hedley built alocomotive. In1824,
thefirstlocomotive, byGeorge Stephenson, traveled six
miles perhour. In1829, theRocket made aspeed of
fifteen miles perhour. In1834, theEirefly Locomotive
made aspeed oftwenty miles anhour, andin1839,
theINorth Starmade aspeed ofthirty-seven miles per
hour.
Man used theairaspower forsailing vessels long
years before heeverdreamed that itcould beused to
travel thrubyairplane. The firstidea ofsteam navi-
gation waspatented byJonathan in1713, andlater in
1783, asteamboat byPitch. In1793, the first real
steamboat byEulton. OnAugust 9,1803, Fulton's
steamboat, "The Claremont,'' made itsfirst tripupthe
Hudson. In1807, Eulton started asteamboat lineon
theHudson. OnJuly 15,1819, the firststeamship
made atripfrom !N"ewYork toLiverpool intwenty-six
days. InOctober, 1829, alocomotive bysteam car-
riages started inLiverpool. InJune, 1838, the"Great
Western" made atripfrom Bristol, arrived in'New
York, making thevoyage ineighteen days. Thenext
record forocean travel wasmade in1851when the
"Pacific" crossed theAtlantic in9days, 19hours and
25minutes. In1917, aGerman submarine boatmade
asuccessful tripfromGermany toBaltimore.
Theadvent ofautomobiles, orgasengines, began in
1877, when the firstgasengine wasinvented byOtto.

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 87
Ib1879, agasoline motor wasinvented bySelden. In
1892, the firstautomobile wasoperated byC.A.Dur-
yeSL. Note that thiswasrepeating the500-year cycle,
and100years before thefirstattempt wasmade tostart
anironrailway, andin1783, the firsttime aballoon
wentupwhich carried apassenger.
Inourmodern times thefirstattempt byman tocon-
quer theairbymeans ofplane orballoon wasinJune,
1783,when Joseph andStephen Montgolfier built the
first balloon, but itcarried nopassengers. IniTovem-
ber,1783, forthe firsttimemanwentupinaballoon

aballoon from St.Louis toHenderson, IvT.Y.,intwenty
hours; thegreatest distance accomplished uptothat
time. In1900, Count Zeppelin flewthefirst dirigible.
In]^ovember, 1903, "Wilbur andOrville Wright made
their first flight inanairplane which roseunder its
ownpower. l^Tote thathiswas100years after Fulton's
firststeamboat wentuptheHudson, again repeating the
100-year cycle. InJuly, 1908, Glenn H.Curtiss flew
hisfirstairplane. InJuly, 1909, Charles K.Hamilton
flewfrom 'NewYork toPhiladelphia —seventy-four
miles. Note 100years before this, in1807, Fulton
started the firststeamship lineuptheHudson.
From 1914 to1918, airplanes wereused inthegreat
World War; 100years before steamers began crossing
theAtlantic Ocean forthefirsttime. InJune, 1919, first
non-stop flight from St.John's, Newfoundland, toIre-

Notehowtheairplane followed 100years later after
thefaststeamer across theAtlantic. Asrailroad and
ocean transportation made rapid progress from 1807 to
1838, soisairplane transportation making rapid prog-

Themonth ofEebmary slowly passed away. Cotton

alsoveryhappy andcongratulated Robert onbeing able
tobuycotton very close tothelowlevel inJanuary.
March wasthemonth tobring disappointment to

OnSaturday morning, May 7th,Mr.Kennelworth

Robert then confided toMr.Kennelworth thathe

confided that liewasgoing totrytogethertoelope with
himandgotoISTew York. Mr.Kennelworth toldhim
thathecould take thegoodnews toMarie thathewas
going togivethem awedding present of$10,000.00,
which was lessthan half oftheprofits hehadmade.
Hewasgoing tocontinue toholdthecotton untilRobert
thought itwastime tosell.
Ontheafternoon ofMay 28th, Robert boarded atrain
forSherman, Texas, with thelightest heart thathehad
everexperienced inhis life. ISTow that hisdream was
really going toberealized, hewasnever sohappy. He
figured thatwith themoney hehadmade andwith
Marie's money, andthe$10,000.00 which Mr.Kennel-
worth wasgoing togivethem, hewould have about
$18,000.00 which would givehim capital tocontinue
tospeculate inthemarket andmoney forhisplans on
hisgreat airplane.
Asthetrain rolled across theplains ofTexas and
Robert watched thesunsetting across theprairies on
thatSaturday afternoon, hedreamed ofthedaywhen
he,likeLindbergh, would cross thecountry inhisgreat
airplane. Hecould think ofnothing elsebutLind-
bergh's great flight andwhat itmeant totheworld. He
realized that Ezekiel's prophecy ofthatwarwhich was
tocomeandbefought intheair,wascoming true,and
thegreat plane described byEzekiel, theeagle with
wheel within awheel, would onedaybecome areality.
Hecouldnow seethepossibilities ofhisdream being
fulfilled andhewassureofsuccess.
Marie welcomed himwithenthusiasm andopen arms.
Shewas soproud ofhimand sohappy thathemade

good inthemarket. Hehadbeen sothoughtful tobuy
cotton andcorn forherand sold outthecorn with
$1,100.00 profit. ShetoldRobert thathewasawon-
der;thathewasoneofthegreatest young men inthe
world andagenius, andthathewould beagreater
manthanLindbergh when hewas asoldasLindbergh.
Robert saidthatonJune 9th,hewould be21years
ofage,andonthatdayhewanted tobemarried and
start onhiscareer asarealman.Hewanted togo
back toTexarkana after theholidays, winduphisaffairs
andgetready togotoJSTew York. Wanted hertogo
withhim, starting Saturday, June 4th, sotheywould
arrive onSunday, June 5th,inSt.Louis, bemarried,
andproceed immediately tol^ew York. Heasked
Marie what shethought about going toherfather, tell-
inghimhehadnowmade goodandhadenough money
tostart out,andaskhisconsent totheir marriage.
Harie said that itwas useless; thatherfather would
never consent toherleaving school andbeing married,
nomatter howmuchmoney theman shewasgoing to
marry hadtotake care ofher.Her father wasbent
onherfinishing hereducation andsheknew itwould
beahopeless case. There wasnousetalking about it.
Sheasked Robert ifhedidn't think itwould bebetter
forhertoremain inschool foranother year ortwo,
tofinish hereducation, andthenshecould joinhimin
ISTewYorkandbemarried. Shethought itpossible that
hemight getalong better forawhile without her.But
Robert would notlisten tothisand toldherthathe
would never gowithout her.Hisfuture happiness and
success depended upon herloveandencouragement.

Herlovehadguided himsafely thusfarandwould lead

when hewould comehome atnight from hiswork or
study, tofindherthere andseeherbeautiful eyes, the
lights thatwould guidehimontosuccess. Shecould
either makehimthemost miserable man intheworld
orthehappiest. Hisentire future andfatewere inher

agreed tokeep herpromise shehadmade tohimlong

would leave father, mother, brothers and sisters, andgo
withhimanywhere, evenunto theends oftheearth,
andthat ifheinsisted, shewould elope because she
knew thatwastheonlywaysince herfather would not
give hisconsent.
OnSunday, May 29th, Robert andMarie went to
Dallas, Texas. Theyhadplanned when theywereready
toelope, thatMarie would leave from Dallas onthe
^^Sunshine Special" intheafternoon ofJune 4th.She
wastokeepherplans absolutely secret andRobert was
toboard thesame train thatnight atTexarkana, and
after thetrainwasoutofTexarkana, hewastofindher,
goontoSt.Louis together, bemarried there onSun-

Robert wasextremely happy andtalked ofnothing but
thesuccess thatwastocome tothem ;ofhisgreat plane

tecting thecountry inthegreat airbattle which hewas
surewas yettocome, when foreign countries thru
their jealousy, would attack theUnited States from the

that intheendUncleSamwould win; thattheStars
andStripes would proudly floatfrom thegreat buildings
inNewYork, andthattheywould livetoeeethatday
andhewanted herthere withhimwhen hisgreat "ship"
would helpwinthevictory forhiscountry. Walter
Kennelworth wasinthecityandtheywere going to
work together oninventions anddiscoveries thatwould
helpwinthewarwhich heknewwassure tocome.
Itwasthemost interesting andpleasant Sunday that
theyhadeverspent together. They drove around Dallas
andtalked over their future plans. Sunday afternoon
theyreturned toSherman, andMonday forenoon Rob-
ertspent with Marie. They went outtothecemetery
andplaced some flowers upon thegraves ofsoldiers who
had losttheir lives indefense oftheir country.
Robert talked ofthegreat featofLindbergh andof
thehonors thathewould receive from theforeign coun-
tries,andtoldMarie what agreat timetheywould have,
asMr.Kennelworth wasgoing toNewYork andthey
would allbethere atthegreat reception when Lind-
bergh returned. Hesaidgood-bye toheronMonday
afternoon and started back forTexarkana, knowing
thatthenexttimehewould meet her,would beonboard
thetrain forSt.Louis, where shewould become his
wife.
From thattime on,Robert counted theminutes, in
anticipation ofthegreat happiness ofthefollowing
Sunday when theywould bemarried inSt.Louis. He
wasstrongly attracted toSt.Louis because Lindbergh
had leftfrom there inthe"Spirit ofSt.Louis,'' onhis
successful flight. Hethought itwould begood luck to

112THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
marry inSt.Louis and startfrom there to'NewYork
tospend theirhoneymoon.
OnTuesday morning, May 31st,Robert started early
toMr.Kennelworth's office asthatwas tobehislast
dayinthe officeandhewasanxious tocleanupallthe
business necessary andrender Mr.Kennelworth allthe
service possible before hewent away. Heconfided to
Mr.Kennelworth thearrangements ofeloping with
Marie. Mr.Kennelworth toldhimthathewould ar-
range togotoNewYork about the11th ofJune and
wassorry thathecouldn't make thetripwithMarie and
Robert andseethemmarried inSt.Louis. Buthesaid
toRobert, ^That isthetimewhen twoyoung people
liketobealone, andIamafraid thatIwouldn't bea
verygood chaperon onthetrip. So itisallforthe
bestandyouwillgetalong allright without me."
Robert toldMr.Kennelworth thathefigured accord-
ingtohiscycle theory, cotton should besoldoutabout
June 1stor2nd, thatthere would beareaction. He
hadalsofigured that itwastime tosellwheat andcorn
forareaction.
OnJune 1st,Robert soldouthisJuly cotton at

bethegreatest start ofallhis life^ ashewasstarting
itunder favorable conditions andwith plenty ofmoney.
Heknew that success wascertain andwasnever more
hopeful.
OnSaturday, June 4th,heclosed hisshort contract
inJulywheat at1.43and hiscorn contract at1.02.
Hehadmade aprofit ofover$2,000.00 onwheat which
brought hiscapital upto$9,000.00. Mr.Kennelworth
hadtaken Robert's advice andgone short ofwheat and
comonJune 1st,after selling outhiscotton. Cotton
declined fromJune 1stasRobert figured itwould. He
toldMr.Kennelworth onSaturday morning thathewas
going tobuyinhiswheat and corn, because hewas
getting ready togoaway thatafternoon andwasnot
going tomake anymore trades until hehadarrived in
^N^ew York. Hewould have everything incashand
ready tomake anew start after thehoneymoon.
Mr.Kennelworth hadsoldwheat andcorn heavily
andhadmade over$50,000.00 sincehestarted tofollow
Robert's advice. Hemade back allthemoney hehad
lostintheslump inoilstocks in1919 andwasvery
grateful toRobert. Hehanded Robert 'NewYork ex-
change for$10,000.00 asawedding present. Toldhim
thathecould callonhimforanyadditional help that
hewanted infinancing thebuilding ofhisairplane or
foranyother purpose. Robert assured him thathe
would notneedanymore help ;thathecouldmake all
themoney hewanted andthat hissuccess wasassured.
Robert toldMr.Kennelworth thathemade over
$4,000.00 forMarie onher little capital of$400.00
withwhich shehadstarted. Mr.Kennelworth wasvery

much elated over this. Thiswasthe firsttimehehad
heard about Marie putting up$400.00 tobuy cotton.
HetoldRobert shewasthekind ofawoman tomarry,
theonewhobelieved inhimandwould backhimwith
hermoney andeverything else. liebelieved itwaslove
oftheright kind—that success was sure tofollow.
Robert wassohappy thatafternoon thathecalled Marie
onthelong-distance 'phone, andtoldherofhisgreat
success inthemarket inwheat andthemoney Mr.
Kennelworth hadmade; toldherthattheyhadnow a
working capital ofaround $25,000.00 andwith that
much money, inE"ewYork itwould beonly aquestion
ofafewyearswhen hewould beamillionaire. The
main thing, however, wasnotmoney buttheusehe
wanted toput ittoincompleting hisinvention. Marie
wasveryhappy andtoldhim thatshewasmaking ar-

afternoon onthe^'Sunshine Special," andafter thetrain
pulled outofTexarkana, hewould findheronboard.
Hewas tokeep everything quiet andnot letanybody
know anything about theelopement, asherfather might

somewhere andthatMr.Stanton might findoutabout

CHAPTER XI
AT7P.M.June 4tli,1927, Robert walked intothe
J_\.Railroad Station atTexarkana andbought aticket
for St.Louis, with areservation onthe^'Sunshine
Special." Thiswasthegreatest andhappiest moment
ofhislife.Heknew thatMarie wasalready onherway
andthatinacouple ofhours thetrainwould arrive and
hewould goaboard forSt.Louis^ where hewastomake
herhiswife. After buying histicket, hewent over to
theHuckins Hotel andmetMr.Kennelworth forafinal
conference and tosaygood-bye. HetoldMr.Kennel-
worth thathefigured itwould betime tobuycotton
onalittle reaction Monday morning, and alsotime to
buywheat again. Mr.Kennelworth assured him that
hewasgoing toplunge onhisprofits, and ifhelost
money now, itwould beoutofprofits. Hewasgoing
togetintothemarket andtrytomake alotmoremoney
before hewent toISTew York. Robert saidthathein-
tended towire hisbroker from St.Louis tobuycotton
andwheat forhimonMonday morning.
Mr.Kennelworth bidRobert good-bye with allgood
wishes forsuccess andsaidhewassurehewasgoing
tosucceed, butthat iffailure anddisappointment should
come, heshould always remember thathecould rely
uponhim ;thatayoungman oftenhadtrouble and dis-
appointment andmademany mistakes before hereached
hisgoalandthat ifanything wentwrong inthemarket,

116THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
tiecould always come tohimandaskforanyaidpos-
sibleandhewould gladly grant it.Hethought asmuch
ofRobert ashedidofhisown son,Walter, andwanted
them towork together inNewYork, andwassure that
they could beagreat success. Hewanted Robert to
encourage Walter tocontinue hisstudies along chemical
lines, because hebelieved thatWalter would beable
tomake some great discoveries andthey could work
together togood advantage.
The^'Sunshine Special'^ wasalittle lateonSaturday
night, June 4th,andRobert's heart wasinhisthroat.
Hewasanxious forthattrain toroll in.Einally, when
thewhistle blewandthesignal light intheyard ofthe
Texas Pacific showed the^^Sunshine Special" was roll-
ing in,theglare oftheheadlights onthetrainwasthe
most welcome sight thatRobert had ever witnessed
thru allthedays ofhis life.Heboarded thetrain as
quickly aspossible and satdown nervous andanxious
awaiting themoment when thetrain would getabout
20miles outofTexarkana, sothathemight goback
andlook forMarie.
Theminutes passed slowly away and itseemed like
years before thetrain crossed theRedRiver andRobert
decided that itwas safe togoback tothecarwhere
Marie wasandseeher.Hefound Marie allanxious
andnervously awaiting hisarrival. Sheflew into his
armsandseemed thehappiest woman intheworld and
Robert wastoohappy forwords. They satthere and
talked oftheir future plans until after midnight.
Marie toldRobert thatsheknew ifherfather found
outshewaseloping, hewould make every effort tostop

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 117
herandprevent their marriage, asshewasnotofage,
andhewasanxious that shecomplete hereducation.
Robert asked her ifshehadanyregrets inthesteps she
wastaking, andshetoldhimshedidnot,that ifshe
didhave, shewould never have started. Shethought
itwaswonderful thatRobert hadbeen able tomake
money sorapidly andwasveryhappy thathehadstuck
totheBible andstudied sohard, andnowwasgetting
hisreward forhisfaithandhard work. Sheexpressed
hersupreme confidence inhimandthework thathe
intended todo.Robert hoped itwould beabeautiful
sunshiny Sunday morning when they arrived inSt.
Louis, sothatthey could bemarried andthen proceed
to'NewYork.
Marie seemed very enthusiastic over theprospect of
getting toSt.Louis. Robert hadalittle surprise for
her,andsheaskedhim totellherwhat itwas. But
hesaid, shemust wait until they arrived inSt.Louis.
^^Robert, justsuppose thetrain should bewrecked andI
should bekilled^ orsomething should happen thatI
would never seeyou again, don't youthink youhad
better tellmeabout thesurprise now ?"Hesaid, ^^E'o,
there isnotgoing tobeanywreck. Good luck isfol-
lowing us,andthesurprise willkeep until tomorrow
morning." She said, ^'Robert, Imay notbeable to
sleep. Idon't think Icansleepanyway, after allthis
excitement andhappiness andeverything that istocome
inthefuture." Robert knew thathecouldn't sleep
either, buthewould gouptohiscar, liedown andtry
togetsome restbefore they arrived inSt.Louis the
nextmorning. They agreed tomeet early inthemorn-

118THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
ingandgoback intothedining carforbreakfast before
theyarrived inSt.Louis.
Robert returned tohisberth andtried torest, but
found thathecouldn't sleep. Hethought overwhat
Marie hadsaid about—"suppose thetrain should be
wrecked, orsomething should happen thatyoushould
never seemeagain.'' Hethought thatnothing could
happen toseparate Marie from him, butjustthesame
itwasthethought thatshesaidsomething might hap-
pen.He feltlonesome being separated from Marie.
Shewastwocarsback, buthefeltthatthegoodGod
whohadendowed himwith faithwould protect Marie,
andthatnoharm would come toher ;thattherewasno
danger ofawreck onthe"Sunshine Special" andthat
therewassunshine waiting forMarie andhimself. In
theweesmall hours ofthemorning, Robert dozed off
andhadafewhours ofsound sleep. Hearose early
and dressed. About 8o'clock, hehurried back to
Marie's car,totakehertobreakfast. When hearrived
atherberth, hefound itempty. Hewent back tothe
dining-car tolookforMarie, butcouldn't findherthere,
andthenwentonthru totheendofthetrain, butwas
unable tolocate Marie. ThePullman porter toldhim
thathehadn't seenherthatmorning andthelasthe
sawofherwaswhen Robert wastalking toherinthe
berth latethat night. Robert then searched thetrain
again fromoneendtotheother andbecome uneasy and
anxious about Marie. Hereturned again tohercar
andhadtheporter lookforherbaggage, andafter look-
ingthru the car,found that itwas gone. Robert
wasnow almost frantic andcould notimagine what


=== PAGE BREAK ===

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 119
could havehappened toher,because herbaggage was
gone. Theporter assured himthatthere hadbeenno
hold-up ofthetrain thatnight andthatnothing un-
usual hadhappened. Hehadbeenupallnight helping
people getonand offatdifferent stations buthadseen
nothing ofMarie atanytime. Thetrain conductor was
notified andthePullman-car conductor was told. Both
ofthem searched thetrainfrom oneendtotheother,
andnowhere couldMarie befound.
Robert didnotexplain totheconductor ortheporter
thattheywere tobemarried inSt.Louis thatmorning.
Theconductor toldhim that itseemed plain that in
somewayduring thenight, shemust have leftthe
train because herbaggage wasgone. Robert wasnow
almost inastate ofcollapse. Heimagined allkinds
ofthings which might have happened toMarie.
Thought thatshemight havebecome insane during the
night, andhadthrown herbaggage outofthewindow,
andjumped out. Thought herfather might insome
wayhavefound outabout herplans andhadsome officer
orsomeone secreted t)nthetrainwhohadtaken Marie
offatsome point enroute. Butnomatter what he
thought orimagined, itwasnorelief tohismind be-
cause hedidnotknow where Marie was. Allhisfuture
happiness wasblasted inamoment.
Bythetimethesearch wasover, thetrainwasnearing
St.Louis. Robert began tothink ofallthethings he
could andmust dototryand findMarie. The first
thing hethought ofwastowireMr.Kennelworth, and
havehimmake asearch and ascertain whether her
father ormother knew anything about whathadhap-

pened. Therailroad conductor andPullman conductor
hadtried tocheer Kobert upandassure himthatnoth-
ingseriously wrong could havehappened toher,and
thatforsomeunknown reason shemust have leftthe
train atsome station during thenight without anyone
knowing it,because theywere sure thatshecould not
havejumped outorfallen from thewindow without
someone knowing about itandtheythought therewas
nothing toworry about. Robert haddecided onsend-
ingtelegrams andmaking every search possible tolocate

envelope addressed tohiminMarie's handwriting. He
didnotknow where ithadcomefrom orhow itcould
have gotten into hispocket, buthehurriedly torethe
envelope openandthis iswhat heread:
June 5,1927—3 a.m.
Dearest Robert:
According toyour faith, beIunto you. Love willalways
have faith, understand and wait. Time proves allthings.
You willgeteverything youwant. Iwillcome toyouwhen I
mean themostandyour need forlove isthegreatest.
Lovingly always,
Marie.
"When Robert finished reading this little note, tears
were streaming down hisface.Hewas frantic. He
knew thatthemysterious letter waswritten byMarie's
ownhandandmust havebeen written onthetrain and
forsomeunknown reason shewasleaving him.Heat
oncethought ofhisgreat faith inher,andhisfaith in

=== PAGE BREAK ===

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 121
couldmean :"According toyour faith beIuntoyou—
love willalways have faith, understand and wait.''
Robert thought, "How canIunderstand, howcanI
wait,when Ileftheronly afewhours agosupremely
happy anticipating being married afewhours later in
St.Louis, andgoing ontoIsTewYork tospend our
future lives together. What intheworld canshemean

faithandloveforher. Shehadhadfaith inhimand

saved, nottomakemoney forherself buttotrytohelp
him. Shetoldhimthatshedidn't want themoney, but
wanted him touse itinanywaythatwould helphim.
Then hepondered thenext linewhere shesaid :"You
willgeteverything youwant." Hethought, "MyGod,
there isonlyonething thatIdowant, there isonly
onething inthisworld thatmeans anything tomeand
that ismyMarie, andwhere willIfindher." Reading
thenext lineoverandover, "Iwillcome toyouwhen

Healmost exclaimed aloud,"MyGod,myGod,now
isthetime thatIneedherthemost. Iwillnever need
hermore.How canIgoon? Life willbeablank.
Iwillbeadismal failure without her."Hewondered
ifthere ever could beatime inthefuture when he
would need hermore, when shewould mean more to
him,than shemeant atthismoment.
Hecould imagine nounfriendly circumstances, no
break ofanykind thatwould cause Marie tochange

Asthetrain rolled into theUnion Station atSt.
Louis hestood inthecardazed, withherletter crumpled
inhishand.With aheavy heart hemade hisway tothe
station and satdown tothink what hecould orshould
do. Finally, hedecided tosendatelegram andlaythe
circumstances ofMarie's disappearance before Mr.Ken-
nelworth andaskhisadvice before making anymove.
Robert realized thathemust havetime tocollect his
thoughts, ifheever could think again. Histhoughts
turned back tothedream Marie hadtoldhimshehad,
where some terrible tragedy hadovertaken himandshe
hadgone outofhislifeinamysterious wayandcame
back into itinthesame way.Hewondered ifatthat
timeMarie hadhadanydoubt that shemight not
want tocontinue tocarry outtheplans agreed on.Then
hethought ofwhat shesaid justbefore bidding good-
night inthetrain, when shehadaskedhimtotellher
what thesurprise washehadforherandsaid tohim
thatthetrain might wreck and killherorthatsome-
thing might happen toseparate them. Hewondered
then ifshehadsomething inhermind which she
thought might separate them during thenight, orifshe
intended tohidefromhiminsome way.
Buthemust get allthatoutofhismind—must have
faith inMarie, must understand andwait. Then like

somewhere inthetrain andinafewminutes would
show up,sohedecided nottosend atelegram toMr.
Kennelworth butsimply stay inthestation andwait.
Heopened hissuitcaseandtook outtheBible, and
there began toreadfrom St.Paul,who said that love
suffers longand iskind, seeks not itsown, isnoteasily
provoked andthinks noevil. Robert resolved tohave
patience, tohave faith inMarie, andnever doubt her,
andnever tothink any evilofhernomatter what hap-
pened. Hismind was relieved. He felthappy and
more cheerful, andwashopeful.
Hewaited ashort time inthestation, hoping Marie
would joinhim. Theseconds drifted away likeweeks,
theminutes seemed likemonths, andwhen anhourhad
gone by,toRobert itseemed like years. Hewaited
andhoped ;watched inevery direction forMarie's beau-
tiful eyes, theeyeshetoldherheloved somuch and
always wanted them togreethimwhen hecamehome
from hiswork because theywereaninspiration. Slowly
thehands onthegreat clock intheUnion Station showed
itwasnearly 12o'clock noon. Robert listened atten-
tively astheoldclock tolled twelve times for12o'clock
andeachtime itseemed thattheblood from hisheart
wasslowly trickling away. Hope wasfastgiving away
todespair. Robert found hispatience waning, butthat
wasnottobe.Hemust trust totheword ofGodwhich
said: "O,yeoflittle faith, saith theLord," andmust
trytofindMarie whomeant everything tohim.
Asthe laststroke oftheclock died slowly away,
Robert started tothink again. Hefinally decided that
hewould stay intheUnion Station andhave patience

124THETUNNEL THRUTHEAm
towaitonemore hour forMarie. Hethought thatshe
wasreally playing ajokeonhimandwould surely come
hy1o^clock. While hewaited hecontinued toread
theBible: "The heavenly Shepherd isleading you in
therightway tohisown blessed fold. Leave allto
him, tohisfaithfulness, hislove, hispower, hiswatch-
ful, sleepless care." Kobert decided totrust, tohave
faith andleave italltoGod thatHemight protect
Marie andbring hersafely back tohim.
Then heread thepoem byGerhart:
*'The prison where thou art
ThyGod willbreak itsoon,
And flood with light thyheart
Inhisown blessed noon."
Eobert thought howhappy hewould have been, ashe
expected bythistime tobemarried toMarie andhap-
pilyontheirway tol^ewYork tocelebrate their honey-
moon. Thehourhaddrifted slowly away and itwas
now aquarter toone. Robert wastroubled and dis-
couraged, buthadnotlosthope.Heopened hisBible
andread—Job6:8:
"Oh that Imight havemyrequest, andthatGodwould
grantmethething that Ilong for!"
Bobert knew thathelonged forMarie andbelieved
that ifhehadfaithGodwould answer hisprayers. He
readagain—Job6:11-13:
"What ismystrength, that Ishould hope? andwhat is
mine end, that Ishould prolong mylife?
Isnotmyhelp inme?and iswisdom driven quite
fromme?"

matter what happened, thathewould seekhertothe
ends oftheearth.

passed thru thegates oftheUnion Station forMarie,

heart, which butafewhours agowas filled with love
andhappiness, wassad. Robert looked upasthehands

CHAPTER XII
TheBestThing OnEakth
ByR.L.Cole
JOHN WANAMAKER said: "Ihave forthegov-
ernment, andinmyown business, made contracts
involving millions ofdollars. Ihave signed checks for
millions ofdollars, butthegreatest purchase Iever
made inmylifewaswhen Iwas11years old. Isaved
every penny ofmyhard-earned money andbought a
Bible that cost $2.75. Thatwasmybestinvestment
andhashadmost todowith therestoftheriches of
my life. Every other investment Ihave evermade
holds asecondary place tothe firstandgreatest oneof
them all."
Lord Bacon, theliterary genius and philosopher,
lifted theBible onedayabove hishead, and said:
^'There Godspeaks."
Godspeaks inthe first verse, saying: ^Tnthebegin-
ningGod!"And allthrough theBookwefindexpres-
sions as"Thus saith theLord," "theword oftheLord
came," "God said," "theLordcommanded," etc.,,
These expressions areusedfourthousand times inthe
j
Bible, thus indelibly stamping thedivine mark.'
"All scripture isgiven byinspiration ofGod." In-i
spiration means breathed into. God breathed his;

thouglits intotheBook. TheBook contains thebreath
ofGod,andlivesbecause God lives.
Jesus said:"Heaven andearth shall passaway but
myword shall notpassaway."
TheBible tellsusthings wegetnowhere else. It
tellsusofthebeginning, foronlyGodwasinthebegin-
ning. Ittells ofthebeginning ofcreation, thebe-
ginning ofthehuman race, thebeginning ofthehuman
family ;thebeginning ofsin,thebeginning ofredemp-
tion; thebeginning ofthe arts, sciences, music, agri-
culture, ofnations andlanguages. OftheHebrews, of
law, etc.
Much ofancient history oftheearliest times isbor-
rowed from theBible.
TheBible tellsofthings thataretooccur thousands
ofyears inthefuture. The destruction ofBabylon,
!N'ineveh, Tyre andJerusalem was foretold indetail
andhascome topassexactly aswaspredicted.
The firstcoming ofJesus Christ wasforetold—that
Hewould come tothetribe ofJudah, would beborn of
avirgin, would beborn inBethlehem, would come out
ofEgypt andwould growupin^Nazareth, would be
despised and rejected ofmen, would work miracles,
would bebetrayed byoneofhisown followers, would
befalsely accused, crucified. That theywould gamble
forhisgarment; would beburied inanother man's
tomb, would rise again; thatHis gospel would be
preached toallnations ;that toHimwould begiven a
name greater than anyname. Allthese prophecies
have been fulfilled. Theprophecies oftheBible are
yetbeing fulfilled, andwill allbefulfilled.

JohnWanamaker wasrightwhen hesaidthatthegreat-

"Ah no,mydear Bible, revealer oflight,

Robert feltthat this article hadbeen written especially

hisroom, putinalong-distance callforMr.Kennel-

wasonlyaquestion ofafewminutes until hehadhim
onthe'phone. Between sobs,hetold hissadstory to
Mr.Kennelworth about Marie's disappearance and
asked hisadvice. Mr.Kennelworth toldhim thathe
thought forsome reason Marie mayhave decided to
return toschool andcomplete hereducation, andprob-
ablywasatthattimeonherwayback toSherman. The
bestplanwould betowait until thenext night tosee
ifshereturned, altho itwas possible thatshemight
getback latethat night. Mr.Kennelworth toldRobert
thathewould gotoseeherfather and findoutany

road authorities, andhavethemmake asearch and in-
quire atallofthestations where thetrain stopped that
night onthewayfromTexarkana toSt.Louis, inorder
togetaclue toMarie's disappearance.
After talking withMr.Kennelworth, Robert gotin
touch over the'phone with therailroad officials inSt.
Louis andnotified them ofMarie's disappearance from
thetrain. They promised tosend telegrams toallthe
station agents, tohave allthetrains watched andtryto

ordeal yet—that ofwaiting hourly forsome news of
Marie. Heknew thehours would passslowly andde-

toschool ortoherhome, and ifnonewscamefrom her
thenextdaywhatwould behisnextmove andwhat he
should dototrytolocate her.
Thenexttime Robert noticed thetime ofday, it
wasafter 6p.m.andherealized thathehadhadno
breakfast, lunch ordinner^ buthisheartwasheavy and
hefeltthathecould noteatanything. Theshock had
been sogreat andhadcome sosuddenly thatRobert
found ithard toadjust himself toitortorealize what
itallmeant orwhat itmightmean incaseMarie should
pass outofhis life forever. Itwould mean every
hope blasted, every sweet dream goneandwould leave
himwithanuncertainty oflife, likeashipwithout a
rudder. Hedecided topass thetimebyreading and
seeking consolation intheBible.
Robert hadalways been agreat admirer ofthepoet,
S.E.Kiser; always read hispoems inthedaily news-
papers andafewmonths previous tothis time, had
bought alittlebook entitled, ^Toems ThatHaveHelped
Me," collected byS.E.Kiser. Heremembered that
hehad this little book thatheliked somuch inhis

they arrived inSt.Louis. Thepresent wasawedding

twohearts woven together and tiedwith acluster of
diamonds andpearls. Thiswastobethegreat surprise
forMarie andhewasgoing topresent ittoMarie after
theywere married, asatoken ofthetwohearts that
now beat asone. Robert looked atthisandthought
ofhowthediamonds represented Marie inallofher
beauty andthatshewasapearl ofgreat price.
Itwastoomuch forhim.Hebrokedown completely
andwept likeababy. Alone hewas—themost alone
hehadeverbeen inhislifebefore—awayfrom friends,
awayfrom mother, andabove all,separated from Marie,
whomeant more than life tohim.Hesobbed for
hours. Hisheartwasbreaking, butwith awondering
mind, herealized thathemust have strength, andthat
hemust have faithandhopeon—hopeandbelieve that
Marie wasaliveandheknew that ifshewere alive, there
washope.
Hepicked uphisfavorite little book,"Poems That
Helped Me," andstarted toread. The firstonethat
caught hiseyewas,"Faith" byTennyson:
"Wehavebutfaith; wecannot know;
Forknowledge isofthings wesee;
Andyetwetrust itcomes from thee,
Abeam ofdarkness: letitgrow.

Help thyvainworlds tobearthylight.
Forgive what seemed mysininme;
What seem'dmyworth since Ibegan;
Formerit liesfromman toman,
Andnotfromman, Lord, tothee.'*
This cheered Robert andheresolved tohavemore
faith, realizing thatwhile hecould notseeorunder-
stand Marie's action hemust have faith andloveand
trust her,andtrust thattimewould bring understanding
andsolve theproblem.
Hereadanother poem byAubrey deVere, andthese
words seemed tosink intohisheart ashereadthem:
"Hid it;dropt itonthemoors!
Lost it,andyoucannot find it"—
Myownheart Iwant, notyours

Wewill love, sweet—^butnotyet!
Fling itfrom you—wearestrong
Love istrouble, love isfolly;
Love, thatmakes anoldheart young,
Makes ayoung heart melancholy."
Robert feltthatlovemight betrouble, butthat love
wasthegreatest andsweetest thing intheworld and
thathewould gothruanytroubles intheworld, suffer
anything, only toregain Marie andherlove. AsRob-

thathemust goonregardless ofwhat happened, and
livehislifehoping tofindMarie. About this time,
Robert, tired, hungry andworn out fell asleep. The
nexttime thatheremembered anything, heawoke on
Monday morning with thesunstreaming inthru the

hastened down stairs tothehotel desk toinquire ifany

from theflowers onthetable brought memories ofsweet
kisses and softcaresses which haunted him. Finally,
Robert managed toeatalittle, because heknew hemust
ifheexpected tokeepupandhave strength tofight
onandfindMarie.
When hehadfinished hisbreakfast, hereturned to
hisroomanddecided tocalltherailroad office again and
ascertain iftheyhadanyinformation forhim. The
general passenger agent wasthere, andwasvery courte-
ousover the^phone toRobert. Hehadtaken agreat
interest inthecaseandtheyhadreceived reports from
every station along theline,butnowhere hadanytrace
beenfound ofMarie. Heassured Robert thattherail-
waycompany would useevery effort tocontinue the
search andreport tohimpromptly anyinformation that
they received.
Robert decided tocallMr.Kennelworth onthelong-
distance 'phone athisoffice inTexarkana andsoon got
himonthewire. Mr.Kennelworth said thathehad
gone toseeMarie's father, Mr. Stanton, soon after
Robert's telephone message Sunday afternoon andhad
toldMr.Stanton ofRobert's success since hehadbeen
with hisfirm ;howhardRobert hadstudied andplanned
andhowhehadfigured outthecotton andgrain markets

suchasmall capital. Heconfided toMr.Stanton the
secret ofhowMarie hadsaveduphermoney andhow
muchmoney Robert hadmade onthe$400.00 which he
hadinvested forher.Mr.Stanton andhiswifeweremuch
impressed with thestory and feltthattheyhadbeen
wrong inopposing Marie's love forRobert andtheir

140THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
marriage. They toldMr.Kennelwortli thatwhenMarie
returned theywould givehertheir consent tomarry
Robert then oranytime later. They feltthatthey
might hetoblame foranyharm thatwould come to
Marie orforthesorrows thatRobert was suffering.
However, theywere hopeful thatMarie waseither re-
turning home orwasonherwayback toSherman,
Texas, tocomplete hereducation, and, therefore, were
notgreatly alarmed andintended towait untilMonday
afternoon tofindout ifMarie hadgone back toSher-
man. Mr.Kennelworth stated thatMr.andMrs. Stan-
tonwished him toconvey their sympathy toRobert
and totellhim thattheyhadgreat faith inhimand
wanted tohelpmakehimandMarie happy.
Thismessage wasgreat consolation toRobert because
hefeltthat itwasgoing tosolve theproblem^ thatno
matter what hadprompted Marie's decision toleave
thetrain andnottogoahead andmarry himwhen she
found thatherfather andmother hadchanged their
attitude, shewould beonlytooglad toreturn toRobert.
They could thenbemarried andcontinue onto!N^ew
York where hecould takeuphisstudies andcomplete
thebuilding ofhisairship assoon ashehadmade
enough money todoso.
Mr.Kennelworth toldRobert thathewould callhim
onthe'phone about 8o'clock that night and lethim
know ifanywordhadbeen received fromMarie orif
news wasreceived sooner, hewould callimmediately,
butatanyratewould call at8o'clock. Mr.Kennel-

thatnoharm hadcome toMarie, forhadthere been
anyaccident itcertainly would have been discovered
bythistimebytherailway company. The factthat
Marie's baggage haddisappeared wasconvincing evi-
dence tohimthat insome way, atsome station during
thenight, shehad leftthetrain andhadprobably con-
cealed herself andwaswaiting toreturn onanother
train, later.Hebelieved before thedaywasoverthey
would havesome goodnews inregard toMarie, and
advised Robert togetbusyandgoright ahead with his
trading inthemarket andcontinue tomake money, as
hewassure thateverything wasgoing tocome out all
right.
After Robert received thistelephone message hewas
more hopeful. Hesecured amorning newspaper and
found theheadlines filled withLindbergh. Read about
thepreparations forCaptain Lindbergh's return to
Washington and]^ewYork andtheplans forhisrecep-
tion. Ofcourse, Robert hadlooked forward tobeing
there atthattimeandhaveMarie withhim ashiswife.
Hehadbeen looking forward tothedaywhen hisown
dream would berealized andhewould build oneof
thegreatest airships oftheage.
Returning tohisroom, hefellupon hisknees and
breathed aprayer; aprayer thatonly amanwhose

thatthegoodGod oftheUniverse would return Marie

kind ofaprayer thatamother prays when herchild

thechild thatsheloves.
When Rohert arosefrom theprayer hefeltbetter;
feltthatsome ofthestrength ofthatunseen guiding
hand, which isever acomfort andingreatdemand in
time oftrouble, hadcome tohim. InGodandhisword
alone hefound comfort andconsolation. Herealized
thesignificance ofmoney andhow little itmeant;
thought howquickly hehadmademoney onathousand
dollars inthemarket andnowhowhewould giveevery

that itcouldbuytomakeMarie happy andgivehercom-

After hehadtime tocollect histhoughts, hedecided
tocallhisoldpal,Walter Kennelworth, in'NewYork
onthelong-distance telephone and tellhim allthathad
happened insuch ashort time.
Robert hadnotinformed Walter thathewascoming

himfrom St.Louis onSunday morning after heand
Marie hadbeen married, and, ofcourse, heknew that

shocked atthenews andsaid: ^^Robert, Marie isjust

love. There isnothing toworry about. Iknow her
ways better thanyou do.''Hewassurethateverything
would beallright. ButRobert feltthattoomuch time

to'NewYork, butRobert toldhimhewould never leave

thatMarie would showupsoon. Atthesame time, he

And girdmefortomorrow's chance.
Thispoem seemed tofithiscaseandheread itover
carefully. Heresolved that regardless ofdiscourage-
ment ordisappointment, blasted hopes, lost ideals or
shattered dreams, hewould stillhave thecourage to
exert himself for"Tomorrow's Chance."
After reading thispoem hebegan tothink ahout the
future andhisplans. Heknew thathehadintended
togointothemarket again onMonday orTuesday,
butthethought came tohim—What good w^ould money
donow,without Marie ?However, heremembered her
letter saying, "According toyour faith, beIuntoyou."
Therefore, braced himself andagain determined tohave
faith togoon,watching andwaiting forMarie.
Robert bought theevening paper andlooked overthe
financial pageandnoted that cotton hadgonedown as
hehadfigured itwould. Thefollowing daywasthe
time that hisforecast indicated that itwould strike
bottom sohemust pullhimself together andbuysome
cotton, both forhisown account and forMarie's.
Wheat had alsodeclined andhefeltthat itwastime
tobuywheat foranother advance ashiscycle indicated
anup-trend torunforthenexttendays. Robert looked

146THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
over thestock pageandnoticed tlieheading; "Major
Motors advances above 200^anewhigh level.'' Robert
hadfigured outthatMajor Motors would notadvance
much above 200before itwould beashort saleforbig
profits. Hefigured outfrom thecycle ofMajor Motors
that itwould hold until along inJuneandJulyandthat
itwould decline toaverylowlevel in1928, sohede-
cided hewasgoing togoshort tohold foralongcam-
paign andmake afortune.
Robert was stillholding hisRight Aeroplane stock,
which hehadbought at31onMay 21st, thedaythat
Captain Lindbergh completed hissuccessful flight to
Paris. Hefigured thathecouldmake agreat fortune
bybuying Right Aeroplane stock andholding itfor
years andatthesame time selling Major Motors short.
Themarkets inWheat, Cotton, Major Motors and
Right Aeroplane were alldoing justexactly ashehad
calculated they would. The fact thathewasmaking
money onRight Aeroplane stock encouraged himtocon-
tinue hiswork onhisown plane.
Robert didnotforget sweet Marie orwhat shemeant
tohim. Atthesame timeherealized what thestudy
oftheBible hadbrought himand feltthatthru the
aidofthatbookandtheknowledge andwisdom hehad
gained through itsteaching, there would beaway to
findMarie ifshewere alive.Hebelieved shewasand
hewould hope and wait. But inthemeantime he
would trytomake somemoney inorder toprovide all
theluxuries andcomforts forherwhen hefound her.
Since Marie's father andmother hadagreed towith-
draw alltheir opposition totheir marriage, hethought

that assoon asMarie heard thisshewould certainly
come tohimorcommunicate with him.
OnJune Yth,Robert sentatelegram tohisbroker
tobuy500bales ofOctober Cotton and500bales of
December Cotton attheOpening onTuesday morning.
Healsoordered him tobuy100,000 bushels ofJuly
Wheat andgaveanorder tosell500shares ofMajor
Motors when itreached 203. After sending these tele-
grams hereturned tothehotel feeling some better and
hoping thatwhen heheard fromMr.Kennelworth on
thelong-distance 'phone hewould havesomegood news.
Soheatehisdinner andreturned tohisroom towait

'phone callsandwasinformed thatnonehadbeen re-

cluded towait forthelong-distance call,hoping that
itwould bring good news.
Atabout 8:15 thetelephone rangandMr.Kennel-

fromMarie byherparents, andthattheyhad called
uptheschool inSherman, Texas, andnotaword had
beenheard from herthere. Theschool informed them
thatshehad leftschool onSaturday afternoon andhad
notbeen seen since. Ofcourse, Robert knew shehad
leftSherman tomeethimandwasnowmore anxious
andworried than everandfreely expressed hisgreat
anxiety toMr.Kennelworth. Mr.Kennelworth was
Btillhopeful andtried tocheer andencourage Robert.

Mr.Kennelworth saidthatheplanned toleave forNew

stay inSt.Louis until hegotsome definite word, or
anyway remain there until Mr.Kennelworth arrived

Solive, thatwhen thysummons comes tojoin

Robert read another poem on"Perserverance" by

Herealized thatperhaps allthegood things oflife
donotcome touseasily andthatwemight have togo
through sorrows andtrouble totryour faith. Robert
decided topersevere andtrytobephilosophic andhope,
nomatter what happened, andtocontinue towatch and
wait forgoodnewsfrom Marie.
Before heretired that night, Robert read"The

forward toTuesday, the7thdayofthemonth. Hehad
learned thatthe^'7th" wasasacred day,andhadoften
talked toMarie about thenumber 7,andthenumber
oftimes itisspoken ofintheBible. HowGodhad
blessed the7thdayandmade ittheSabbath ;howmany
things hadcome topassonthe7thdayofthe7th
month, orthe7thyear referred tointheBible. In

Robert awoke onTuesday morning feeling much bet-

read allabout thereceptions being planned forColonel
Lindbergh andagain thewish stole into hisheart and
thehopewasrevived thatinsomewayMarie might be
withhimwhen Lindbergh arrived inJ^ewYork. Later
inthedayhereceived telegrams athishotelfrom his
broker, advising ofthepurchase ofOctober andDecem-
bercotton and alsothepurchase ofJuly wheat.
Robert decided toconsole himself byreading the
Bible. Heread Job,andrealized that he,too,would
have patience towait until histimeshould come. !N'oth-
ingcould shake hisfaith inMarie orshake hisfaith
inthewisdom ofAlmighty Godwhom, Robert fully
believed, would answer hisprayer. Hehoped that be-

come.
Ashewasreading theBible thebellboy brought him
aletter stamped Texarkana, and, ofcourse, Robert
hoped itcontained some news ofMarie. Heopened

While Marie isquiteyoung andwethought tooyoung to

make mistakes inopposing their children andfrequently the

CHAPTER XIII
THATafternoon^ after three o'clock, when theafter-
noonnewspapers were out,hebought apaper and
found thatcotton andwheat hadadvanced many points
and thathenowhadanice profit onthepurchases
made thatmorning. Indeed, thegods ofgood fortune
andfinance were smiling onRobert, buttheGoddess
ofLovewasfrowning andhemust have patience. As
thesunwasslowly setting andthedaywaswaning, he
watched insadness because nonews hadcome from
Marie. Hefirmly resolved thathewould carry outhis
intention andplace thepersonal notice inthepapers
thefollowing dayfornews ofMarie, ifsomething did
notcome thatevening.
Robert called Mr.Kennelworth onthe'phone in
Texarkana andagain metwith disappointment. ISTot
aword hadbeen heard from Marie andherparents
werenowgrowing more anxious andfeared thatthere
hadbeensome accident orfoulplay insomeway. They
weremaking asearch inevery direction; Cityand
County officials hadbeen notified and alltheschools
thruout thecountry wereonthelookout forMarie and
making every effort toobtain some information about
her. Robert toldMr.Kennelworth about hisplan to
insert thepersonal notice andMr.Kennelworth agreed
with him.Hethought itwould beagood ideaand
liebelieved that ifshewere secretly hiding somewhere,

shewould surely seethepapers because sheherself
would beanxious toknowwhathappened toRobert and
whathewasdoing.
Robert arose earlyonWednesday morning, June 8th,
hastened tothenewspaper o;ffices andplaced theper-
sonal notices toappear thefollowing day.When he
returned tohishotel, forthe firsttime sinceSunday
hethought ofhisbirthday, June 9th,when hewould
be21years ofage.When hethought ofthisagreat
hopecame intohismind. Hedecided thatMarie, for
someunknown reason, washiding until hisbirthday
andintended thatthey should bemarried onthatday
andshewasgoing tobehisbirthday present. Robert's
imagination went wild.Hewaselated overthehope.
Itseemed likeasudden inspiration tohim. Itwould
bejust likeMarie towait until hisbirthday togivehim
thesurprise ofhislife,andthink thisdelaywould only
tryhisfaithandpatience andshewould know justhow
much shemeant tohim, butdidnotthink ittoolong
tokeephimwaiting ifhereally loved herashesaid
hedid ;thathewould have patience andwait.
Robert wassurethathisadvertisements inthepapers
thefollowing daywere going tobring results andthat
probably Marie, just assoon asshesaw it,would come
tohim. Sohereally began toplanandhopeandget
ready foramarriage totake place onhisbirthday.
Hewas sohappy over thissudden thought, soelated
thathe'phoned Mr.Kennelworth again thatnight and
toldhim allabout it.Mr.Kennelworth, half-hearted
buthopeful, agreed with Robert that there might be
something init,thatMarie might havehadsome plan

ofthiskind inmind, andsincerely hoped thatRobert
wasright andthat thisbirthday would bethehappiest
ofhislife.
After Robert talked withMr.Kennelworth, heim-
mediately called Walter Kennelworth onthe'phone in
'New York, toldhim allthathadhappened, about his
placing thepersonal notices inthepapers, about his
hopes andtheories thatMarie would showuponhis
birthday. Walter saidthat itwould bejust likeherto
doatrick ofthatkindandthat thismight bejustwhat
itallmeant. Hethought thatRobert hadstruck onthe
right ideaandwashopeful, too,thatthemarriage would
takeplace onRobert's birthday. Hewas tocallRobert
onthe'phone thenextdayorRobert should callhim
just assoon ashegotanynews. Walter wanted to
send congratulations forhisbirthday andhiswedding
day. The factthatWalter was socheerful andshared
Robert's views andhopes inthematter, made Robert
much happier.
After Robert hadtalked with Walter, thebellboy
came andbrought aspecial-delivery letter andatele-
gram. Robert opened thetelegram hurriedly, hoping
that itwassomething from Marie, butfound itwasa
telegram from hismother inwhich shecongratulated
himonhisbirthday thefollowing day,andencouraged
him tohope forthebestandnotgiveway todespair
incaseMarie didnotshow up.The special-delivery
letter was alsofrom Robert's mother, andread:

ever.Heretired thatnight afterhaving alight supper,
veryhappy, looking forward tohisbirthday with great
hopes and expectations. His 21st birthday meant a
great deal tohim,meant more thananyother birthday
because hehoped that itwould bring Marie. Heknew
thathehadstood thetestofherabsence andthathe
hadunwavering faith, thatthehadnever doubted her
motive, nomatter even ifhecould notunderstand it,
andthathewould notcensure heractions. When Marie
returned andwasonce sure thatsheknew allthis,he
would mean more toherthanhehadever before and
shewould only lovehimthemore. After all,perhaps
this little disappointment would mean something good
inthefuture.
That night heread over allthepoems thatMarie
hadeverwritten him orsenthim,andread over the
poems thathehadwritten her,because hehadkept a

Major Motors wasselling around 203andheknew that
hisbroker must have sold 500'shares short forhim at
this price. Hefigured thatMajor Motors would not
advance above 205^/2 before itstarted onabigdecline.

These messages wereveryencouraging but itwasnow

tosend atelegram toMr.Kennelworth asking him to

ROBERT bought evening newspapers andlooked
overtheFinancial Page ;noted that cotton, wheat
andcornhadadvanced that day. Hisbirthday had
indeed been asuccess, financially, andhis21st birth-
dayfound himontopoftheworld, but thiswas
notwhat counted with Robert. Thegreat disappoint-
ment wasthat hishopes forMarie onthatdaywere
blasted, buthehadnotgiven up.Ashelooked overthe
newspapers hesawanadvertisement headed, "Madam
Cleo," Clairvoyant. The advertisement stated that
Madam Cleocould re-unite theseparated andbring back
lostlovers. While Robert hadnever been toaclairvoy-

called toseeMadam Cleo. Shetoldhimthathehad

cheer because Marie lovedhimonly; that ithadbeen
acaseofnervous indecision which hadcaused Marie to
disappear, andthatshewould return just assuddenly
asshehaddisappeared.
Robert feltmore hopeful andreturned tohishotel,
hoping togetsome news ofMarie. There were no
letters ortelegrams. Hecalled upthebroker's office

something tomake him joyful. Professor Joyful's
advertisement stated that"with thescience ofAstrology,
hecould tellwhen success would start, when trouble
would endandreveal when marriage would take place.''
Robert wasagreat believer inAstrology because hehad
found thisgreat science referred tosomany times in

Theworks oftheLord aregreat, sought outofallthem

inthehope thatthegreat science ofAstrology would
throw some lightupon thedisappearance ofMarie. The

andasRobert hadnoappointment, hewould have to
wait awhile. Glancing around thewalls ofthe office
hesawsome beautiful cards ofpoems hanging onthe

Sunbeams after showers arebrightest,

Westarve each other forlove's caress;
Wetake, butwedonotgive;
Weknow itiseasysome soul tobless,
Butwedole outaffection, giving lessand less,
Until theworld becomes bitter andhard.
Robert feltthathehadnotbeen stingy with hislovefor
Marie andthathehadshowered hisaffection npon her.
TheBible saidthatlovebegetteth loveandheknew ifhe
received ashegave, hisreward would bethereturn of
Marie andherlove.
Bythistime, thesecretary announced thatProfessor

asked hisdateofbirth, saidhewasbomJune 9th,1906.
TheProfessor made outhishoroscope hurriedly and
toldhimthatVenus andMars were inconjunction by
transit inthesign Leo,which ruled theheart; that
Venus applied toatrine ofUranus, andthatwhile he
could givehimhopeful newsandcould assure himfrom
hishoroscope thathewould onedayfindMarie, he
could notoffer false hopes andstate thathewould find
herwithin afewdays. Said therewasapossibility of
hisfinding herwithin twoyears, but itwould probably
bethree orfouryears before shewould evercome into

Heassured Robert thatMarie was alive, thatnoharm
hadcome toher,andthatnone would, that shewas
carrying outherown secret plans; was faithful to
Robert, andhadnoother lover. HetoldRobert that
hewasaborn genius andinthenextfewyears would
make agreat success inspeculation andinthefield of
aviation. While Robert wasdisappointed, hefeltthat
this scientific manwas telling thetruth anddecided
totake hisadvice, trytobepatient, and toface the
future with hope. TheProfessor toldRobert that his
horoscope indicated thathewould eventually realize
allhishopes andambitions. Venus, inthesignCan-
cer,promised happiness inlove affairs eventually, but
Neptune therein indicated askeleton inthefamily closet
andsome secret mysterious happenings inconnection
with thehome anddomestic relations. Robert toldhim
ofhisplans togotoNewYork andtheProfessor stated
thatNewYork Citywasruled bythesignCancer, and
inview ofthefactthattheplanet Venus, theGoddess
ofLove, waslocated inthat sign,hewould eventually
meet orfindMarie inNewYork City. This cheered
Robert greatly because heknew hewanted togoto
NewYork tomakemoney inspeculation andcomplete
hisinventions. Professor Joyful toldRobert thatVenus
progressed inthesignLeo,which rules theheart, would
cause some great sorrows andheartaches when there

Hisruling planet applied toanevilaspect ofUranus,
indicating great worries following thestarting ofthis
journey. Said thathehadplanned hismarriage foran
unfortunate dayandthat itwasbetter that itdidnot
takeplace atthattime. Assured Robert thattherewas
nodoubt about therealizations ofhishopes inthefu-
ture, butthatthedelay was inevitable. Hetoldhim
thattheclairvoyant whopromised thathewould find
Marie inafewdays,wasonlyencouraging hishopes,
andthat science, which could bedepended upon, did
notconfirm these hopes, oratleast theimmediate
realization ofthem. There wasapossibility ofhis
finding Marie inaforeign state orcountry or
thatsome news would come tohim ofherfrom a
great distance. Heasked Robert forMarie's date of
birth. Robert toldhim thatheknew shewasborn
onOctober 6th, butthat hewas notsure ofthe
year, buthethought itwasin1908. TheProfessor
toldhimthat ifthisdatewas correct, itwould confirm
allthathehadtoldhimandindicated alongdelay be-

Robert returned tohishotelmore hopeful andwith
thefirm decision toface thefuture andcarry outhis

making money inwheat and cotton and thatRight
Aeroplane wasmoving hisway; thathewasShort of
Major Motors andexpected tomake afortune selling it
allthewaydown. Mr.Kennelworth expressed hiscon-

himforhisgreat loveforMarie andhisfaith inher,

"Iamsureyouaretomake yourdreams come true.
TheBible says :There isnothing better foramanthan

Work istheonlything todrown your sorrows. Ifyou
gotowork, complete your inventions andcontinue to
study, thetroubles willdisapear. Time will flylightly
byandbefore youknow it,Marie willreturn toyou."
Then Robert repeated afewlinesbyDora Greenwald:
^'Joy isaworking thing. Itbuilds upwhile itenlarges the
whole nature. Itisthewine tostrengthen theheart, tobrace
ittocarry noble enterprise.'^
Mr.Kennel worth said,"That isvery fine, Robert, but
youmustwork forthejoythat isyettocomeandyour
great love forMarie willstrengthen your heart and
brace you toattain allyour aims. Love isthegreat
power behind theuniverse and itisthegreatest ofall
powers. Emotions arethemotive power behind every
great achievement, andwithout emotion nothing will
everbeaccomplished. There arethree great emotions—Love, FearandHate, which actuate every deed, good

Robert thenshowed apoem on"Love" which hehad
written toMarie andone,"TheGarden ofLove," which

liehadwritten atthetimeheandMarie hadtheir first

wasverymuch impressed with Robert's ability asa
writer. Hesaid, ^'Robert, thisproves tomethatLove
brings outthebestinamanandthatwhen hefinds a
goodwoman hissuccess isassured.''
Robert talked ofhowhehadread theBible where it
said that there eventually would beoneGodandone
united people andthatLovewould ruletheworld. How,
since alittle boy, hisMother hadtalked against war
andprayed forthedaywhen warswould cease and
manwould follow thecommand given byJesus Christ:
*^Love thyneighbor asthyself." Hehoped and felt
surethatthedaywould come butthattheBiblemade it
plain asheunderstood it,thattherewould yetbeagreat
warfought intheair,when deadly chemicals would be
usedandthegreater portion ofthepeople onearth
would bekilled. Then would come peace, whenGod
would rule theworld andLove would bethemotive
behind every act.Then nations would nolonger be-
come jealous ofeach other andgotowar. Robert said,
"Ihavemade agreat study ofwars inthepastandhow

Robert arrived in"NewYork Cityandweremet atthe
train byWalter. Robert wasveryhappy tomeet his
dearest friend, and itwasconsoling tobewith him.
After their arrival, theywent totheHotel Vanderbilt.
Mr.Kennelworth went outtoseeafriend and left
Robert andWalter tochat alone. Robert toldWalter
oftheterrible sufferings hehadgonethru since Marie's
disappearance and ofhisgreat disappointment. He
talked ofthesuccess hehadmade inthemarket andof
thefuture when hehoped tocomplete hisgreat inven-
tionwith theaidofWalter andhisknowledge ofchemi-

times. Butimmediately after talking ofhisfuture
plans hismindwould revert back toMarie andhewould
start talking about herandbemoaning thefactthatwith-

himtoforget about her—thattimewould bring changes
andthathewould findanother girlwhowould takethe
place ofMarie. Robert wasindignant andtoldWalter
thattimewould never change him; thathewould re-

never heard ofheragain. Walter saidthatMarie was

Walter said :"This iscertainly amysterious letter. I
don't understand itand Idon't suppose Marie did
either. There isnothing inthisletter toexplain whether
shewasleaving youornot,orwhy orwhere shewas
going oranything about it.^Now, Kobert, don't you

Robert refused tolisten toanysuch reasoning. His
faith inMarie wasunshaken. Hislove forherwas
great enough tounderstand, tohave patience andwait.
Marie could orwould donowrong, andnoamount of
evidence would everchange him.
Mr.Kennelworth returned tothehotel and after
dinner toldRobert thathewanted tohave aconfidential

CHAPTER XY
OlSTthefollowing day^Monday, June 13tli, Mr.
Kennelworth, Robert andWalter arose early tobe
ready forColonel Lindbergh's triumphant march up
Broadway. Robert wasvery enthusiastic about itand
talked about what agreat achievement itwasandwhat
itmeant totheworld, especially totheUnited States.
Walter toldhim thattheymust getbusyand start to
layouttheplans tobuild Robert's great airplane.
When they started outonthe street, Robert began to
talk ofMarie andsaid thathehoped thathewould
findherthat day. Thru allthesurging crowds, he
stared intheface ofeverywoman, hoping thatMarie,
ifshewas alive, might have decided tocome tol^ew
York fortheLindbergh reception. Itwasagreat day
forColonel Lindbergh, andagreat dayforRobert,
because itencouraged hishope fortheday,and be-
lieved itwould come topasswhen airplanes would con-
quer theworld andbring universal peace. He felt
thatastate ofperfection could never bereached until
thebrotherhood ofman, founded onlove,was estab-
lished.
Walter told hisfather andRobert about agreat play
thathehadbeen tosee: '^One forAll."Hewasanxious
forthem tosee itandhadsecured tickets forthatnight.
Robert wasimmediately interested. Hewasattracted

toMolly andsaw inhergreat sacrifice forEric an
example ofMarie. Astheplay neared theend,and
Molly wasingreat sorrow, andhersecret sacrifice had
become known toEric, Robert could restrain hisemo-
tions nolonger. Heturned toMr.Kennelworth and
said, ^^Iwonder ifhe'llbemanenough toforgive her
andappreciate her, asthegreatest woman intheworld
forhim. Will hismind bebroad enough torealize that
shemade thesupreme sacrifice because ofherunselfish
love. !b[ow thathehassucceeded andhastheworld at
hisfeetwillheturnfrom herandcondemn herasthe
world usually does?" Mr.Kennelworth said: "You
canseethatEric isnowweighing thematter inhis
mind and ishesitating. Wecanonly waitand see."
Robert said, "IfEric lovesMolly asIloveMarie he
willnow lovehermore after this.'' Robert watched
Ericwith every muscle inhisbody tense, asEric read
thereceipt written byChattox and alsohewatched
Molly andherexpression assheleaned overthestaircase
andread thereceipt over Eric's shoulder. Hesaw
Eric slowly foldthereceipt around thelittle booties for
thebabyandplacethem inhispocket andwalk slowly
away. Robert waswondering what Ericwasthinking
ofandwhat hisdecision would be.Then came the
final climax—Eric, afterknowing all,tookMolly in
hisarmsandgaveherthekisswhich Robert knewmeant
foregiveness andunderstanding. Hethen realized that
love, justasMolly saidinthebeginning, wasthegreat-
estthing intheworld, andmeant more than allthe
money intheworld. Robert jumped tohisfeetand
shouted, "Hurrah forEric," and said, "that's thekind

ofloveIhave forMarie andnomatter wliatmayhave
happened orwhat sheshould dointhefuture, mylove
isthekindwhich willunderstand, forgive andforget."
Hetoldthemhowhewasimpressed with thestory
intheBible where thewoman wasbrought before Jesus
accused andhowtheJesus said,"Lethimwho iswith-
out sin, castthe first stone," andwhen theyhad all
disappeared hesaid: "Woman, dothnoman accuse
thee," andsheanswered, "JSTo, Lord." Jesus said,
"JSTeither doI.Goyourwayandsinnomore." Rob-
ertsaidwhen theworld once realized thegreat power
ofLove, that jealousy, enmity, allaccusations andthe
desire forpersonal gain,would passaway. Thatwhen
Love alone dominated thehearts ofmenandwomen,
warswould benomore, andthatmenwould seenoevil
intheir fellow-men asEricsawnoevilinMolly's sacri-
ficebutknewandunderstood thatgreat loveforhimwas
themotive thatprompted heractions. Robert quoted
Daniel 2:22:
*'Herevealeth thedeepandsecret things. Heknoweth what
isinthedarkness and the light dwelleth within him.A
kingdom "v\'hich shall never bedestroyed, consume allother
kingdoms andstand forever."
Hesaidthatwhen thedaycamewhenmenwere ruled
bythelawofloveandunderstood each other, akingdom
would beestablished thatwould never bedestroyed, and
that itwould consume allother kingdoms. Robert be-
lieved thattheUnited States, theland ofliberty, was
created never tobedestroyed, andthat itwould eventu-
allyconsume allother nations andrulebythelawof
loveand justice, that itwasGod's willthat itbecome

tliemost prosperous country and tliebanking nation of
theworld. Believed that thenation referred toin
Psalms 147 ;20wastheUnited States:
"Hehath notdealt sowithanynation andasforhisjudg-
ments theyhave notknown them. Praise yetheLord."
Walter wasnotsoenthusiastic andsure about the
power ofLove asRobert. Youcannever tellwhat a
woman will do,hesaidandreferred toProverbs 30:18
and19:
"There bethree things which aretoowonderful forme.Yea,
fourwhich Iknow not,—thewayofaneagle inthe air,the
wayofaserpent upon arock, thewayofaship inthemidst
ofasea,andthewayofamanwith amaid."

Robert Goedon's Great Campaign" inMajor Motors
OnSunday, June 19,1927, Robert Gordon spent the
daystudying hischarts andworking outhiscycles for
stocks, cotton andgrain. Hewasshort ofMajor Motors
andwaswatching itvery closely. Onthisdayhemade
anewandgreat discovery ofatime factor fromwhich
hefigured thatMajor Motors would decline until about
June 30thandthen startanadvance which would last
until about September 16th, 1927,when theCompany
would be19years oldand atthattime thestockwould
reach finalhighandwould thengodown toFebruary
toApril, 1929. Hefigured thatthestock should ad-
vance toaround 270bySeptember 16thandmadeup
hismind towatch itclosely andcover hisshorts ifit
wentdown around June 30th, andthen start buying
thestock. OnJune 30th itdeclined andhebought in
hisshort contracts andbought forlong account 500
shares ofMajor Motors at192^. Hedecided topyra-

September 7ththestock advanced to253andheraised

never reached butonSeptember 14th arapid advance
wasonandhebought 300shares more at258, giving
himalineof2200' shares ofstock. Hefigured that it
should advance onSeptember 16th toaround 270.
When themarket advanced to272 atthistimehesold

Inthiswayhefigured thatthemarket would have to
beathimtenconsecutive times forhim tolose allthe
profits hehadmade^ and hisstudies ofpast records
showed that thiscould never happen. Heplaced orders
tosellmoreMajor Motors at128, 118,108and98be-

latter part ofDecember, 1927, and after thattimehe
would putoutshoi-ts again onarally toholdandpyra-
midonthewaydown intotheSpring of1929. His
great discovery ofwhat stocks would doatacertain age
enabled him tomake enormous profits when stocks
reached theagewhere theywould have fastmoves up
ordown inavery short time.
October, 1927, wasabeautiful month inl^ew York.
Theweather waswarm andthesunshone brightly every
day. Itreminded Robert oftheFall of1926when he
hadgone toSherman, Texas, tovisit Marie. He
thought ofwhat agreat change hadtaken place inone
year, ofthefortune thathehadmade inthemarket,
butmoney would notbuyrelief forhisaching heart.
Days, weeks andmonths haddrifted slowly by,but

over $300,000. Hehadkept Marie^s money ina
separate account from hisownandheroriginal $400.00
wasnow over $20,000. Robert continued tokeep
heraccount separate; hewanted tomake allthemoney
hecould andhave itasasurprise forMarie, toprove
toherhisfaithfulness andthoughtfulness when shewas
away, andalsotoprove hisconfidence inherreturn.
Robert became known as^TheBoyWizard ofWall
Street." Hisfamebecame known andoldmen ofWall
Street talked about hismarvelous success. Robert re-
fused tobeinterviewed bythenewspapers ortellany-
thing about hismethod ofworking inthemarket. Sel-
dom ever visited abroker's office andmade veryfew
friends. Heworked upon hisinvention, andWalter

bythename ofHenry Watson whowasaveteran of
Wall Street, nowover70years ofage,hadmade and
lostmany fortunes andhadseen thebiggest andbest
plungers goontherocks inWall Street. Walter intro-
duced Air.Watson toRobert andhebecame verymuch
interested intheoldman's reminiscences. Hetold
Robert thehistory ofDaniel Drew andgothim toread
thebook ofDrew's life,which showed howDrew, after
making $13,000,000 lost itallanddied practically
apauper. Also toldthehistory ofDaniel Sully; how
hemade $10,000,000 to$15,000,000 inthe Cot-
tonmarket, butbyviolating natural laws lost itallin
afewdays inthecrash ofCotton inMarch, 1904, and
thendisappeared from thefinancial horizon. How Liv-

lated millions, owned fineyachts, losteverything, had
gone thru bankruptcy, buthad later recouped hisfor-

who atonetimehadover tenmillions dollars paper

Allen A.Ryan, attheheight ofhisfame,when hede-

Mr.Watson alsotoldRobert howDurant hadbecome
thegiantmotor magnate andformed theGeneral Motors
Corporation in1908andhadmade agreat success, ac-
cumulating millions before thewardays and after-
wards. Hewasinfullcontrol ofGeneral Motors and
wasreputed tobeworth overahundred million dollars
when thestockwasselling at$410.00 intheSpring of
1920. Durant wasvery bullish andtalked ofGeneral
Motors going verymuch higher. Deflation started in
theSummer of1920, and allstocks declined rapidly.

atafigure reported tobearound $5.00 pershare, andhe

himfamous. Later Durant organized anewcompany
andcameback fast.Hewentback intothestockmarket
andinthegreat Coolidge Bullcampaign from 1924 to
1927wasagain adominant factor inGeneral Motors
andother stocks andwasreputed tohavemade fifty
millions, ormore.
The oldman said thatDurant wasoneofthevery
rare exceptions ofmenwhohadgone broke inWall
Street andhadbeen abletocome back after theywere
60years ofage. Told Robert thatWall Street wasa
place ofupsanddowns—mostly downs, andthat the
time toquitwaswhen youwereyoung andhadmade
yourmoney.
Robert explained toMr.Watson thathewasnot
guessing andgambling onhope butwasfollowing sci-
enceandnottrading onhuman judgment ashefollowed
thelawofcycles aslaiddown intheHoly Bible. Mr.
Watson said, "Iwishyousuccess, andforyour benefit
Iwillgiveyoumyopinion astothecause ofmost of
thefailures inWall Street, forIknow thehistory of
themenwhohavemade thegreatest amounts ofmoney,
andknow most ofthem personally. Selfishness and
greed were thecause ofthefallofDaniel Drew. He
wasnotloyal tohisassociates. Hisideawastogetthe
money andlookoutforhimself regardless ofwhom he
hurt. Conditions changed andDrew failed tochange
with them. The result was thathedied apauper.
Thomas W.Lawson, themanwho wrote, Triday the
13th,' wasoneofthemost daring traders thatWall


=== PAGE BREAK ===

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 203
Street haseverknown, worth atonetimeprobably forty
tofiftymillion dollars. He, too,died practically penni-
less. AtonetimeLawson had thebacking ofthe
Standard Oilcrowd andturned against them after they
hadhelped him tomake millions. Inmyopinion, he
cutoffthehand thatfedhimand hisruthless attack
onmenwhohadbeen hisfriends, wasthecause ofhis
downfall. Menmust beloyal topositions oftrustand
notreveal secrets ofgreat financial dealsbywhich they
profited." Robert saidthatwashisidea. Aslong asa
manremained loyal tohismother, hiscountry, his
associates ;above allhiswife orsweetheart, success was
bound tocrown hisefforts. Hebelieved inthelawof
compensation ;thatwhen amanbroke faith with others,
hehadbroken faithwith himself, andthatfailure would
follow.
Mr.Watson toldRobert thatSullymade hismoney
incotton, andafter accumulating millions, quit special-
izing incotton andbegan totrade instocks andvarious
other commodities, which divided hisattention andhe
wasunable toconcentrate oncotton alone, thething that
brought himthegreat success. ^^Icould gooverthehis-
tory ofScales, Livermore, Durant, Ryan andthebal-
ance ofthegreatmen ofWall Street, andinanalyzing
their trading, theoneweak pointwould befound inall
ofthem. They diversified toomuch. Didnotspecial-
izeinonecommodity orafewspecial stocks, butspread
allovertheboard. The result wastheyhadtoomany
irons inthefireandwhen onething started togowrong

outofstocks andcommodities onwhich theyweremak-

ingmoney andkeep those thatweregoing against them.
Another weak point wasthatwhen luckturned against
aman inWall Street, hekeptontrying torecoup his
losses instead ofstopping just assoon astherewasan
indication thatthetidehadturned against him. Most
men attheheights ofprosperity lose their sense of
goodjudgment, become inflated with their success, think
they areinfalliblO; refuse tofollow science ortheadvice
ofanyone, with theresult thatthey continue tobuck
thetide till alltheirmoney isgone."
"Mr.Watson," saidRobert, "Ibelieve that ifaman
starts outtomakemoney forunselfish purposes, hewill
succeed. That iswhat Iamgoing todo.Your experi-
ence isvery valuable tome.Your intimate knowledge
ofthecause ofthefailures ofothermen isagood les-
son. Ihave studied theBible very carefully because I
believe itisthegreatest scientific book ever written.
Thelaws areplainly laiddownhow tomake asuccess.
There isatimeandaseason foreverytliing, and ifa
man doesthings according tothetime, hewillsucceed.
TheBible makes itplain thatnot allareborn tobe
prophets, nortobefarmers, doctors orlawyers, butthat
eachcansucceed inhisown special line, according to
timeandplace. Ifmenwould onlyfollow theBible and
know thatthere isatime tostoptrying tomakemoney
andtokeepwhatyouhave, thenwait foranother season
when thetime isripe,theycould continue tosucceed in-
definitely. Hasanymanevermade alarge fortune out
ofWaQ Street andkept it,Mr.Watson?" "Oh, yes,"
hereplied, "ifthere were notexceptions totherule,
business would notcontinue torun. Icould tellyouof
dozens ofthem, butonestriking example isthatofthe

lateE.H.Harriman wliodiedworth about three hun-
dred million dollars. Hehadprobably made outofthe
market ahundred million dollars inthelastthree or
four years ofhislife." Robert asked, ^'How didhe
doit?"Mr.Watson answered, "Hestuck tooneclass
ofstocks—railroads. Hestudied them dayandnight,
never diverted hisattention toother lines. Ibelieve
thathepossessed some mathematical method which en-
abledhimtoforecast stocksmany months andyears in
advance. Ihavegone over hismanipulations andthe
stocks hetraded in,andfound thattheyconform closely
tothelawofharmonic analysis. Hecertainly knew
something about timeandseason because hebought at
theright timeandsold attheright time.Hepaid a
great price forhissuccess, because heneglected his
health, sacrificed everything tomake hisrailroads a
success anddied tooyoung. Suchmen arethebackbone
ofourcountry's prosperity. Constructive geniuses of
thiskind arefewandfarbetween andweneedmore

Herefuses toface facts, andfacts arestubborn things.
Hope spurs uson. Itmaybeananchor tothesoul,but
averyslimanchor inspeculation^ when facts areagainst

Mr.Watson toldRobert that hisfriend Walter had
related tohim allabout hislove affair andthedisappear-
ance ofMarie. Hesaid,"My boy,thegreat loveyou
have forherisnowfurnishing thehopewhich willcarry
youtosuccess. When thathope isgone,youwillhave

himthatMarie hadsaidthat anticipation wasgreater

many fortunes inWall Street, andwhen things have
gonewrong andIhave reached thedepths ofdespond-

byfriends ofmyprosperous days, thenwhen there
seemed nothing elsetolivefor,nothing tomakemefight

steal overmeandIwould again hope thatsome day,
somewhere, Iwould findmyKatie.'' Here theoldman's
eyesgrewdimwith tears.Hedrewanoldwallet from
hispocket, took outapackage, slowly unwrapped it.
Intherewasapicture inalittle goldframe. Theaged
hands trembled, hisvoice grewweak ashehanded the
picture toE-obert withsome faded flowers which he
hadpressed outandkeptandsaid :^These flowers were
picked byherown little hands over forty years ago."
Hethen broke down andwept bitterly. Robert was
deeply moved bytheoldman's great devotion tohis
long-lost sweetheart andbegged him totellmore ofthe
story.
Theoldman dried hiseyesandwent on—"Over 50
years agowhen Iwasayoung man, Ilived near St.
Joseph, Missouri. Iwent toschool atacountry school-
house. Katie Larson wasabeautiful young girl.We

Iwasanxious tosucceed anddecided thatIshould make

swiftly by,Iwasnotassuccessful asIhoped tobe,
and finally onedayIreceived thesaddest news ofmy
life—Katie hadmarried. Irealized thatshehadprob-
ablywaited andhoped formetomakeknownmyinten-

knew itwas allmyfault. Ishould have confided my
plans toherandasked hertohave patience andwait.
From thatdayIwasachanged man.Myheart was
broken and ifnohopehadbeen leftforme,Iwould

moved away after marrying andprobably itwasthe

Iworked harder than ever. Success crowned myefforts.

After that time, shelostfaith inmeandweslowly

Ihavecome toWall Street that Ihave nothoped to

alive. Ihave often tried tofind her,buttheyears have
brought changes. Shemoved away toCalifornia and

because itwillmake youabetter man, aslovealways

Robert wasverymuch interested intheoldman's
story, butvery sorry that ithadnever ended ashehad
hoped itwould withhimandMarie. Mr.Watson told
Robert thathethought hehadwonderful ideas about
speculation, andthat ifhewould only stick tothemand

HetoldRobert thegreatest testofamanwould come
when hereached thestage ofgreat prosperity. That
almost anymancould stand reverses butveryfewcould
stand prosperity. Money could buy somany things
which were notnecessary toaman's happiness and at-
tracted somany people whowould dohimharm rather
than benefit him thatmostmen started onthedown

thathewanted itsohecould help others and benefit

tohimandthat ifhepossessed theweak point which
hadbeen theundoing ofmany men, hewould belost.
Thatwasbeing influenced byflattery from beautiful
women. Hesaid, ^^Remember, myboy,they are at-
tracted tothemoney andnottotheman, butfewmen
cankeep their heads atatimewhenwomen andmen
crowd around topraise their success. Iremember a
poem thatIused toreadwhen Iwasaboy, part of
which runssomething like this:
^They crowd around me,those stately dames and belles,
Andpay tometheroyal homage that allgreat success
compels;
Butwhere isshe,thatsweetheart ofmyformer years.

You will find itso,Robert. Men desert youwhen

Iadmonish younottoputyour trust inmoney ormen.
Continue asyouhave, trust God, have faith inhim,
stick toyour first love,andhappiness andsuccess willbe
your reward."
When theoldman had finished talking, Robert
noticed thattheeyeshadbecome still, hischeeks were
pale, hishand dropped limp athisside. Robert rushed
tohimandsoon realized thattheoldmanwasvery ill.
Hehurriedly summoned adoctor. Soon after laying the
oldgentleman onthecouch andmaking himcomfort-
able, thedoctor arrived. After hasty examination, he
toldRobert that theend v/asnear. They decided to
send foraminister andwhen hearrived, theoldman

adding, ^^Will youdieinthefaith ofaChristian?'*
Theoldmansprang upfrom thecouch suddenly, astho
newstrength hadbeen instilled inhisfrail oldbody.
Heraised hishandandshowed thedoctor thepicture
and said, "Will that faith bringmeback Katie, the
onlywoman Ihave every really loved?'' Thedoctor
knew that hisstrength wasfastwaning andgothim to
liedown onthecouch again. Theminister whispered
consoling words tohim, toldhim that"God soloved
theworld thathegave hisonlybegotten sonthatwhom-
soever believeth onhimshould notperish, buthave
everlasting life." Again heasked, "Doyoubelieve in
Jesus Christ ?Willyouaccept thefaith ?"Again the
oldman replied, "Will that faith bring back tomemy
Katie?" His voice w^asgrowing weaker, thedoctor
knew that itwasamatter ofbutafewmoments. The
minister again bent overhimandwhispered slowly,
"Will youaccept Jesus Christ asyour saviour anddie
inthefaith ofaChristian?" With afaltering weak
voice heanswered, "Will thatfaith givemeback Katie,
thegreatest loveofmylife?"Thedoctor turned tothe
minister andsaid, "Tiehasgone tohisreward." "With
alove like that, such loyalty andfaith toalong-lost
lovemust receive itsreward inheaven andajustGod
willextend mercy toasoul likethat," saidtheminister.
Robert wasintears. Hefeltthathehadnotonly lost

man's going hadtaken something from hislife,yetthe

benefit tohim.Heknew thathewould livefaithful to

CHAPTER XVII
ROBERT turned totheBible forconsolation. Read
every chapter oftheSong ofSolomon. Wasvery
much impressed withChapter 2:14:
Omydove, that artintheclefts oftherock, inthesecret
places ofthestairs, letmeseethycountenance, letmehear
thyvoice, forsweet isthyvoiceandthycountenance iscomely.
Robert longed tohearMarie's voiceandprayed thatshe
might come forth from hersecret hiding place. He
readChapter 8:6thand7thverses:
Setmeasasealupon thine heart, asasealupon thine arm,
forlove isstrong asdeath; jealousy ascruel asthegrave;
thecoals thereof arecoals offirewhich have amostvehement
flame.
Many waters cannot quench love, neither canthefloods
drown it;ifamanwould give allthesubstance ofhishouse
for love, hewould utterly becondemned.
Robert realized thatnothing could quench hisloveand
thatMarie v^astheonlyremedy forhisaching heart.
Turning toDaniel 9:21,heread:
Yeawhile Iwasspeaking inprayer, even theman Gabriel
whom Ihadseen inthevision atthebeginning being caused
toflyswiftly, touched meabout thetimeoftheevening obla-
tion.
Robert knew that thisindicated thatpeople did flyin
theolder days,andthatwewerenowonlyrepeating past
cycles. HereadChapter 12 :4thverse:
Letthou, Daniel, shutupthewords, and sealthebook

even tothetime oftheend;many shall run toand fro,
andknowledge shall beincreased.
Robert thought thatwewerenownearing thetime of
theendbecause manwasrunning toandfroinfast
automobiles andtraveling swiftly thru theairinair-
planes ;thatnew discoveries were beingmade andthat
loLOwledge was increasing. Hemust hasten hisnew
invention. Heread the12th verse:
Blesseth ishethat waiteth, andcometh tothethousand
threehundred and fiveandthirty days.
Kobert believed thatheunderstood thecycle andknew
thenumber ofyears, months anddays referred toin
Daniel's prophecies. Calculated thatfromMarch, 1931,
until theendofJune, 1932, would betroublesome times
fortheUnited States. Depression, warandpanic would
hangoverthedestinies ofhiscountry. Robert hadgone
deeply intotheBible study inorder tolearnmore about
thegreat science ofAstrology. From theBible he
interpreted thathebelonged tothetribe ofIssachar, the
fifthsonofJacob andthat thisname indicated price,
reward, recompense. Heunderstood from thisthathe
would have topaytheprice, buthewould receive the
reward forhisfaithfulness anddevotion toMarie.
Robert turned toGenesis, Chapter 30,17thand18th
verses:
AndGodhearkened unto Leah, andsheconceived andbore
Jacob, the fifth son,andLeah saidGodhath givenmemy
hire,because Ihave givenmymaiden tomyhusband; andshe
called hisname Issachar.
HereadGenesis 49:14and15,where Jacob blessed his
12sons:

Issachar isastrong ass,couching down between twoburdens
andhesawthat therestwasgoodandtheland, that itwas
pleasant; andbowed hisshoulders tobear, andbecame a
servant unto tribute.
Robert knew that thiswasthedescription ofaman
bom inJune under thesignGemini andthathewas
born tobear aburden, thathemust serve hispeople
andbeacomfort andhelp tocarry their burdens. That
thesignunder which hewasbornwasadouble-bodied
sign,known asthesign ofthetwins, thatthings would
repeat inhis life, thathewould havemany upsand
downs, butthathewould reach hisreward thru science.
Hewasanxious tolearn ofMarie's characteristics from
theBible andthru Astrology andfound thatshewas
bornunder thesignLibra, thesignofthebalance, ruled
bytheGoddess ofLove, Venus, which endowed her
withhergreat beauty. Reading Genesis 29 :32,hefound
thatMarie belonged tothetribe ofReuben, "And Leah
conceived andbareasonandshecalled hisname Reu-
ben; forshesaid ^Surely theLord hath looked upon
myaffliction ;nowtherefore myhusband willloveme.'"
Thesymbol andmeaning ofthisname is"onewho sees
the sun,'' thevision ofthesun,and indicates great
intuition, keenperception andpower offoresight. Gene-
sis49:3-4:
Reuben thou artmy firstborn,mymight andthebeginning
ofmystrength, theexcellency ofdignity, andtheexcellency
ofpower; unstable aswater, thou shalt notexcel.
Robert understood that thisreferred toMarie's charac-
teranddisposition. Shewasunstable, changeable and
moody, buthefeltthatherlovewas fixed and that

eventually shewould return tohim.Heread allthe
books hecould getonAstrology andbegan tounderstand
whythings hadhappened asthey had. Itmadehima
better philosopher andhelped him tobear hissorrows
with greater patience.
Robert continued reading Isaiah 45:13 :
Ihave raised himupinrighteousness, and Iwill direct
allhisways: heshall buildmycityandheshall letgomy
captives, notforprice, norreward, saith theLord ofhosts.
Thisprobably meant thatthetimewould comewhen the
Lordwould directmanandthatwhen warscame and
prisoners weremade captives, theywould besetfreewith-
outprice orreward. ItwasRobert's idea that thiswas
theway itshould bewhen loveruled theworld.
Robert readHebrews 11:3 and5:
Through faithweunderstand that theworlds wereframed
bytheword ofGod, sothat thethings which areseenwere
notmade ofthings which doappear.
ByfaithEnoch wastranslated thatheshould notseedeath;
andwasnotfound, because Godhadtranslated him: forbe-
fore histranslation hehadthistestimony thathehadpleased
God.
Robert believed thatEnoch wentaway inanairplane
andknew thatfaithwasthegreat sustaining force, and
thatwithout faith itwasimpossible toplease God, for
hereadwhere itsays,^Tor hethatcometh toGodmust
believe thathe is,andthatheisarewarder ofthem
that diligently seekhim." Robert knew thathehad
faith andthat that faith would sustain himduring
thetime oftrials andtroubles. InRomans 12:2:
Andbenotconformed tothisworld, butbetransformed by

therenewing ofyour mind, thatyemayprove what isthat
goodandacceptable andperfect willofGod.
Robert knew andunderstood howtorenew hismind and
body because heknewwhat Jesus meant when hesaid—
^^Destroy thistemple andinthree days Iwillbuild it
upagain." Heknew that itreferred tothetemple of
thehuman body.
Robert read the9thto13th verses ofthesame
Chapter:
Letlovebewithout dissimulation. Abhor thatwhich is
evil; cleave tothatwhich isgood. Bekindly affectioned one
toanother with brotherly love, inhonor preferring onean-
other; notslothful inbusiness; fervent inspirit; serving the
Lord, rejoicing inhope, patient intribulation; continuing
instant inprayer.
Robert intended tobepatient intribulations andwas
going tobekindandshow brotherly love ;hewould have
faith, hopeandpray forthedaywhen hewould again
have Marie. Lovewasthefulfilling ofthelawand
reward waspromised forobedience tothat law. The
more hereadtheBible themore hewasconvinced ofits
great value andthat alloftheknowledge andinstruc-
tionthatmanneeded foranypurpose oratanytime,
wastobefound inthatgood oldbook. Robert decided
thathewould notonlypraywithout ceasing, butwould
spend some ofthemoney thathehadmade, totryto
findMarie, asnowordhadeverbeen received ofherup
tothistime.Heemployed adetective agency tomake a

Kennelworth that October cotton would advance to
around 18.50 to18.75 before therewasanyimportant

CHAPTER XVIII
AFTER making hiscalculations onthePresidential
-Zjl election in1928, Robert sentthefollowing Fore-
cast toMr.Kennelworth:
July 20,1927.
1928PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
Inorder todetermine theconditions that willprevail during
1928andwho willbeelected, wemust lookuppast cycles.
Irefer you toEcclesiastes 3:15—^'That which hath been is
nowandthatwhich istobehath already been, andGod re-
quireth thatwhich ispast."
Weknow thatwearerepeating past cycles asreferred toin
Ezekiel's Prophecy—Chapter 20 :46—"Son ofman setthy
facetoward thesouth, anddrop thyword toward thesouth,
andprophesy against theforest ofthesouth field, andsay
totheforest ofthesouth, Hear theword oftheLord, Thus
saith theLord God, Behold, Iwillkindle afireintheeand
itshall devour every green tree intheeandevery dry tree,
theflaming flame shall notbequenched, and allfaces from
thesouth tothenorth shall beburned therein."
Thetroubles inNicaragua, thedestructive floods andstorms
which have visited Florida, andthedestruction bythefloods
along theMississippi during thepastSpring allshow that
troubles arestarting inthesouth.Weareinacycle which
willrepeat andcause wars which will startfrom thesouth
andsouthwest, probably Mexico. Allofthese events willhave
agreat bearing onthePresidential election in1928, because
war willbeintheairandthepeople willbeverymuch upset.


=== PAGE BREAK ===

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 219
Asreferred toinExodus 32 :17—"Andwhen Joshua heard
thenoise ofthepeople asthey shouted, hesaidunto Moses,
There isanoise ofwarinthecamp." There willbepolitical
warsandrevolutionary changes intheUnited States in1928.
people willwant tochoose new leaders. Read Judges 5:8—
"They chosenewgods; thenwaswarwithin thegates: was
there ashield orspear seenamong forty thousand inIsrael?"
Thepeople willneed tochoose anableleader toprepare for
thegreatwarinthe air.
Ihavemade astudy ofPresident Coolidge's date ofbirth,
nameandnumbers. Heisthestrongest man thattheRepubli-
cans have, buthehasnotwanted toaccept thenomination
and willprobably not ifhecangetoutofit.Hehasthe
bestchance ofanyRepublican forbeing elected. Along about
March orApril, 1928, some important event willhappen
which islikely tocause President Coolidge torefuse toac-
ceptthenomination. When theconvention meets inJune or
July there willbelong delays, dissatisfaction and fightsamong
theoldRepublican leaders astowhom they willnominate.
From thecycle thatwearerepeating, there isastrong indi-
cation thatPresident Coolidge willnotberenominated. He
willdosomething which willcause large financial interests
andmoneyed men towithdraw their support from him.
SinceGod requires thatwhich ispast, then past cycles and
events inthehistory oftheUnited States must repeat. We
lookupthenames and dates ofbirth todetermine when
certain names orinitial letters should repeat. The letter "C"
isonewhich repeats inevents oftheUnited States asshown
bytheelection ofGrover Cleveland thesecond time in1892.
President Calvin Coolidge, with the"C"strong inbothnames,
succeeded President Harding, August 2,1923, andwaselected
in1924. Thiswas really arepetition oftheletter "C"the
same asCleveland's second election, andinview ofthefact
thatPresident Coolidge hasserved about 6years, theletter
"C" isnotduetorepeat itsvibration in1928, butmight re-
peat in1932when President Coolidge could possibly beelected
again following thewarandtroublesome times.


=== PAGE BREAK ===

220THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
Themost favorable letters fortheRepublican Party which
could repeat in1928 areB,J,F,andL.Inview ofthecycle
which indicates warfrom 1928 to1932, there isastrong indi-
cation that theletter "L" willrepeat asitdidduring the
CivilWarwhen Lincoln wasPresident. Thismight mean the
nomination ofBorah, Butler, Johnson orLowden. Ihaven't
thedates ofbirth ofanyofthese men, therefore, amunable
tosaybefore thenominations take place andweknowwhom
their opponents will be,whether anyofthemwould beelected
ornot.
Inregard totheDemocratic nomination, thecycle indicates
astrong possibility ofvictory fortheDemocrats oranew
party. Governor Alfred Smith isnotlikely tobenominated
and ifnominated would notbeelected. The letter "S"has
never appeared inthesurname ofanypresident oftheUnited
States, andasweareonlyduetorepeat past events, hehasa
very slimchance ofbeing elected.
The letters F,MandRareduetorepeat fortheDemocrats.
Thismight mean Ford, McAdoo orReed. According tothe
dateofbirth, cycleandnumbers, McAdoo would have amuch
better chance ofgetting thenomination than Smith. Reed
looks stronger than either ofthem. Governor Smith will con-
tinue popular andthepossibilities ofhimbeing nominated
willlookpromising until about May, 1928, when there will
beasudden change ofpublic opinion against him. Support
willbewithdrawn andsome ofthestrong Democratic leaders
willturn toother possible candidates. Smith's name willno
doubt come before theconvention, butIseenochance ofhim
being nominated.
There isastrong indication thatthemanwho willbenomi-
nated willbea"dark horse," amanprobably bom inMay or
June. Revolutionary changes areindicated. Thequestion of
the18thAmendment islikely tosplit both oftheoldparties.
Afarm andlabor party orsome other political party may
spring upanddefeat both oftheoldparties. The public
willbeverymuch divided andsentiment willbebadly mixed
inthesummer and fallof1928.


=== PAGE BREAK ===

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 221
With thepresent data inhand andtheevents that areto
follow thenext Presidential election, myjudgment isthata
Republican willnotbeelected. The President who takes
office inMarch, 1929, will startunder very unfavorable con-
ditions similar tothose which faced President Wilson atthe
timeheentered hissecond termandalsoconditions willrepeat
similar tothose that followed theelection ofAbraham Lin-
coln in1861. There willbetrouble with foreign countries
overimmigration laws. Tariff willbeasorespotandcause
disagreements with foreign countries.
Iwillhavemycalculations madeupforthestock andcom-
modity markets for1928 and1929 soonandwhen they are
completed willsend acopy ofthem. There willbesome big
opportunities forlong pulltrading instocks andconmiodities
during 1928. Iwant you tobeinonthedeals withmeand
hope Icanhelpyoumake amillion dollars.

DECEMBER, 1927, stocks hadbeen declining for
several weeks. Thismonth stocks declined rap-

advanced. Robert hadbeenontheright sideforseveral
months. Justbefore Christmas hefigured thathewould

tocheerthemupatChristmas time. Toldthem thathe
believed Marie wasaliveandthathehadfaith inGod
andwanted them tohave faithandcontinue topray for
Marie's return. Informed them ofhisgreat financial
success and toldthem thathehadcontinued tokeep
Marie's account separate andhadtraded very con-

Afewdays before Christmas therewasabigdecline
inthestock market. Allkinds ofunfavorable rumors
were afloat. Business conditions were bad.War clouds
were gathering thick inEurope. !I^ewspapers talked of
theuncertainties inthenewyeardue tothecoming
presidential election. The public had lostconfidence
andwere selling stocks. Robert decided that thiswas
thetime tocash insohecovered abiglineofShorts in
Major Motors, Central Steel and others. Thiswasa
great Christmas forhim, financially. From hisbe-
ginning with200bales ofcotton inJanuary, 1927, with
acapital of$1,000.00 and$10,000.00 which Mr.Ken-
nelworth gavehim later, thru hissuccessful pyramiding
hehadmade overhalfamillion dollars. Hewasover-
joyed with hissuccess because itwould helphimnow
tocomplete hisairplane and other inventions. His
mind turned back toChristmas, 1926, when hehad
bought Marie abeautiful ringwith themoney hehad
saved. Atthattime helittle realized that somuch
could happen inoneshort year.Hethought ofallhe
could doforMarie thisyear ifheonlyknew where she
was. Decided thathewould buysome beautiful pres-
entsforheranyway andkeepthem until shereturned to
showherthathewasthinking ofheronChristmas. He
bought abeautiful diamond ringandabracelet setwith
sapphires anddiamonds. When thejeweler delivered
themRobert looked them overandthought ofallMarie's
beauty andpurity. Hisfaith inherwas stillsupreme.
Hewasverysadandwept bitterly because hefeltmore
keenly than evertheneed forher.Hewanted hertobe

His heart turned tohisnext dearest friend—his
mother. Hedecided totrytomake itthehappiest
Christmas ofher lifeandhought herevery kind ofa
present thathethought would make herhappy and
comfortable andsentheracheck for$5,000.00 todowith
just asshepleased andbuyanything shewanted.
Begged hertocome toJ^ewYork toseehimsoon after
thenew year, ashewanted hertoseethesights ofthe
city,andthought thetripwould begood forherhealth.
Intheearly part of1928 Robert calculated thatwar
wasinevitable between England andRussia. He fig-
ured thatthewarwould start notlater than thesum-
merandthatmany nations would beinvolved andthat
lateranattack ontheUnited States would come. His
firstairplane wasnowcompleted,—asmall oneaccord-
ingtotheplan laiddown byEzekiel intheBible. The
plane hadfourwings andcould flyoneither oneofits
four sides. Ithadanewmotor with 12cylinders and
could beoperated either with gas, electricity orcom-
pressed air.Hehadconstructed awheel within awheel
sothathecould lower hisplane andlandanywhere he
chose andcould rise straight up.Onemotor hada
propeller inthecenter oftheplane tolift itupwhile
theother motor started itsdirect motion. Hecould
drive hisplane backwards orforwards. Itwasagreat
success andtheboywizard ofWall Street wasnow
hailed asanewLindbergh ofthe air.There wasan
extra motor builtwith acollapsible propeller sothathe
could shift itfrom thecenter oftheairplane tothetail,
enabling ittogobackward orforward ashewilled.

struction ofairplanes.
Robert's next invention wastobuild asilent motor,
oramuffler, which would prevent anysound. Heknew
that thiswould bevery useful inwar. After hehad
completed thisinvention, tested itandproved itasuc-
cess,heoffered ittotheUnited States Government, but
after thearmy officers, whoknew very little about this
newinvention hadlooked itover, theyrefused it.Rob-
ertthen sailed away inhisnewplane which hehad
named ^The St.Marie." Hevisited England, France,
Germany andintheSpring of1928made thelongest
successful flight toJapan^ where hewasreceived with
great honor. Japan wasverymuch interested inhis
newplane andinhismuffler. TheJapanese Govern-
ment quickly closed adealandbought hisinvention for
alargesum ofmoney. Robert feltthatprobably one
daythisinvention would beused against hisowncoun-
tryintime ofwar, butknew that theUnited States
would have tolearn alesson—^that toooften inthepast
American inventions hadbeen sold toforeign countries
because hisownGovernment would notbuythem.
While inJapan Robert wasentertained and intro-
duced tomany beautiful titled ladies andprominent men,

InMay, 1928, Walter received aradiogram from

thoughts, especially when theywere greatly excited or
interested inanymatter. Heread toherfrom the
record onthemachine insubstance exactly whathad
been said toherthenight before. Then heturned to
theBible andshowed herwhere itsaid"Everything
that isconcealed willberevealed, andeverything that is
covered willbeuncovered." Edna wasmore excited
than shehadeverbeen inher life. Sheknew thatthe
machine had revealed thetruth. Then said toMr.
Gordon thatshehadintended totellhimthatmorning
justwhathadhappened andhoped thathewould believe
thatshewasloyal tohimandhadrefused toaccept a
bribe. Hethenshowed heranother record onthema-
chine likeaphonograph record which would record
people's thoughts andtoldherthat itindicated justwhat
shehadbeen thinking about. Themachine hadread
hermind andrecorded herthoughts. Heassured her
thathedidbelieve herandtrust her.Edna wasmoved
totears atthisgreat confidence. Sheknew thatnever
before hadshebeen permitted toseethis secret room
andwhile sheknew ofRobert's great loveforMarie, she
feltthat thisconfidence hehadplaced inherwasmore
than amatter ofbusiness confidence andthathehad
some love forher. Shehadalways admired himbut
hadnever thought ofloving him. ISTow sheknew that
shedidlovehim.
Afewdays laterEdna hadatalkwith Walter, be-
cause shehadknown himbefore Robert came toInTcw
York and itwasthru hisinfluence shehadsecured the
position. Shetoldhimwhat hadhappened andcon-
fided inhimherlove forRobert. Hewashappy to

know thisandhoped thatRobert would fallinlovewith
herashebelieved itwould bebest forhim. Walter
said, "Iamnotanexpert judge ofhowemotions work
inmenandwomen, butthewayforyoutofindouthow
Robert feelstoward you istowatch hisactions, make
notes ofhowoften hespeaks ofMarie, oftheletters he

kind toward him asyouhave always been. Ifina
fewmonths hisinterest inthesearch forMarie wanes,
andheceases totalkabout her, itwillbeasuresignthat

Soon after Walter graduated, Robert called Miss
Quinton into hissecret office onemorning andtoldher
hewasgoing toform anewfirmunder thename of
"Gordon, Kennelworth &;Quinton" andthatEdna was
tohaveaninterest inthefirm, asreward forherfaith-
fulservice. Shewastohelpwith theworkonthesecret

most wonderful man intheworld andthat sheloved
him.Hedrew himself quickly awayfrom her, satdown
inachair andstared outthewindow forseveral min-

Quinton, faced herwith afirmbutkind face, toldher
thatshehadmade amistake inhisactions, thathewas
rewarding herforfaithfulness andthat there wasno
sentiment inthematter, thathedidnotlove her,that
hewasloyal tohislong-lost Marie andwould never love
anyone else. Edna hardly knew what tosay. She
begged hisforgiveness andtendered herresignation.

Hetoldher tliat liewould refuse toaccept it;thatthey
would gorightonandwork together justthesame asin
thepast, ifshefeltthatshecould andwanted to.She
assured him that shewanted toremain aslong ashe
wanted her,andthat inthefuture shewould always
control heremotions.
Walter Kennelworth hadcompleted aspecial course
inchemistry atcollege andwasnowprepared forwork
inthenew firm. Hisfather hadbeen following Robert
inthemarket during thepastyearandhadmade alarge
amount ofmoney. Hepresented Walter with $100,-
000.00, part oftheprofits which hehadmade outof
themarket, with theunderstanding thatthemoney was
tobeused inhelping tofurther Robert's inventions.
IntheFall of1928, Robert andWalter completed
aninvention ofSun-mirrors, whereby theywere ableto
collect theraysfrom thesunandproduce heatpower-
fulenough tomeltdown skyscrapers inafewminutes.
With these mirrors andtheaidofelectricity, they dis-
covered apowerful light ray. Robert knew that thiswas
going tobeofgreat value inthecoming war. They
named thismachine ^'TheDemon ofDeath." Miss
Quinton hadbeenverymuch interested inthismachine
during thecourse ofconstruction, andshenamed it
^^Spit-Fire" because itcould send forth suchpowerful
sparks offire,destroying instantly anymetal that it
touched. They held aconference andagreed that this
newdiscovery must bekept secret andshould never be
used except inthedefense oftheUnited States intime
ofwarandonlythen ifourcountry wasindire peril
andunable tocopewith theenemy. There wasone

234THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
secret connected with tliemachine that only Robert
knew. They intended tostart tobuild agiant airship
inashort timeequipped with"TheDemon ofDeath."
They figured itwould sendapowerful death ray3000
to5000 miles through space, destroying everything
\vithin aradius of700miles. Work wasstarted onthe
newmachine with allsecrecy. Ithadalready been
christened "Marie theAngel ofMercy."
Robert andWalter weremaking money rapidly inthe
cotton market. Thewar clouds were gathering and
Europe wasbuying cotton. Ithadhadabigadvance
andtheywere playing thefastmoves upanddown,
bothonthebuying and selling sides. There isanold
saying thatintimacy breeds contempt, but itdidnot
prove sowithWalter Kennelworth andEdna Quinton.
Onebeautiful morning inearly September, 1928, Rob-
ertGordon stepped intothelaboratory andfound Edna
inthearms ofWalter. Hemade ahasty exit,butWal-
terandEdnaknew thattheyhadbeen caught. Robert
wasveryhappy atthisdiscovery because heknew that
itwas justthething Walter needed tostimulate his
ambitions andgivehimsomething towork for.He
realized what awonderful woman Miss Quinton was,
andthat she, too,needed inspiration that love alone
could give. That evening heinvited Walter todinner
withhimandwhen theywere alone said, "Well, Walter,
thelovebughasgotyou atlast." Walter wasbashful
atfirstanddidn't want totalkmuch about it;thenhe
admitted that ithadcome onvery suddenly when he
andEdna hadrealized thattheywere both inlovewith
each other. Robert toldhimthat itwasinevitable and

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 235
thatnowwasthetime itshould startandthat itwould
bebetter forboth ofthem. They were business part-
nersand itwould makethemmorehappy andsuccess-
fulintheir work. Walter asked him ifhestillhad
hopes offinding Marie. Robert toldhimthathedid—
thathewould never giveupthesearch.
Everything moved along smoothly after this. Walter
andEdnawerehappy intheirworkandtheFallof1928
rewarded them with anewandwonderful discovery.
They hadbeen able toperfect amachine which would
reflect light insuch away astomake anairplane in-
visible and this, together with Robert's noiseless inven-
tion, solved theproblem. Heknewnowthatintime of
war, theplane could beused tosneak upon theenemy
andthattheywould beunable toseeorhear it.After
holding aconference, they decided that thisinvention,
aswell as"TheDemon ofDeath'' should notbepatented
oroffered forsale toanyGovernment, thattheywould
test itoutandkeep itasecret. Here Robert's great
generosity showed itself again when hedecided that
thisinvention should beused intime ofgreatest need for
thebenefit oftheUnited States. Walter said, "Robert,
loveindeed doesmake agreatman,makes himunselfish,
causes him tothink ofhiscountry, ofhismother, his
sweetheart andeverything elsebefore himself. ]^o
wonder youaremaking asuccess andalways will, be-
cause youaredoing right."
Thecompletion ofthegreat machine, "TheDemon
ofDeath," which Robert hadworked onuntiringly day
andnight, wasagreattriumph forhim,buthiswonder-
fulenergy hadbeen exhausted. Walter hadnoticed

236THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
before themacliine wascompleted thatRobert looked
tiredandworn. Hismind lacked itsold-time quickness
andhefeared forhishealth. Robert began toreach the
office lateandceased totakeaninterest inhiswork.
Hewasmoody anddespondent. Thanksgiving Day,
Walter andEdna arranged abigdinner andinvited
Robert. Heappeared verymuchwornandatevery little
dinner. Both Walter andEdna noticed thathewas
lesstalkative than ever before. About anhour after
dinner wasoverRobert fellinafaint.Adoctor was
called immediately andaftermaking acareful examina-
tionpronounced itacaseofnervous breakdown. Said
there must besomething preying onhismind orthat
hehadbeenunder along strain. Walter explained the
disappearance ofMarie andhowRobert hadworried
over thelove affair; hislong, strenuous campaigns in
thestock andcommodity markets andhisworkupon
hisinventions ;thatuptoafewmonths previous Robert
hadbeen able towork almost dayandnight without
showing anyfatigue, butthat inrecent weeks hehad
noticed agreat change inhim. After thedoctor had
heard thestory ofthelove affair andMarie's disap-
pearance, hewassure that alongandneeded restwas
necessary torestore Robert tohisnormal health. He
ordered him toremain absolutely quiet andnot at-
tempt tolook afteranyofthedetails ofhisbusiness.
Afewdays laterWalter persuaded Robert togotoAt-
lantic City,which hedid^andafterremaining thereand
resting acouple ofweeks, hereturned apparently well
andshowed hisold-time strength and vigor. Was
anxious togetback towork andlook after hisspecula-

CHAPTER XX
AStheendof1928 neared, warwasalready raging
jLjl. inEurope. England andRussia hadalready
gone towar asRobert had predicted. Complications
were developing quick and fastandwar clouds were
gathering. Robert knew that itwasonly aquestion of
ashort timewhen theUnited States with allofitsgold
supply, would beattacked andthere would beagreat
battle intheair.Great progress hadbeenmade inavia-
tion. Airplanes were carrying mail attherateof300
miles perhour. Passenger lineswerenow starting all
over theUnited States. "Marie theAngel ofMercy,"
Robert's great ship,wasrapidly nearing completion.
Thenew 12-cyUnder motor hadbeen tested andthe
engineers hadestimated thattheywould attain aspeed
of1000 miles perhour. Robert was elated over the
success andknew thathewould nowbeprepared to
help hiscountry intime ofitsgreatest need.Hehad
beenworking earlyandlateandtheinterest inhiswork
hadkept hismind oifMarie. Yetnotadaypassed
butwhat hemade some inquiries orhadhisdetectives
chase some clewwhich hehoped would lead tothedis-
covery ofMarie, but allefforts were invain.Nonews
hadeverbeenheard ofher.
With thegreat progress inradio messages thru the
air,andradiograms, Robert knew that intime ofwar,


=== PAGE BREAK ===

238THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
secret communications would beneccessary. Spies could
steal codes, andmessages sentover theradio could be
interpreted ;therefore, oneofthegreat needs forthewar
intheairwould beaway tocommunicate without de-
tection. Hefinally succeeded incompleting what he
called "The Pocket Radio." Itwasnolarger than a
watch andworked onthesame principle ofhismachine
forrecording thethoughts ofpeople, only theinstru-
menthadtobeusedbytwopeople whounderstood how
towork it,because thepositive radio wascarried in
oneman's pocket andthenegative intheother andby
pressing thestem, itcould bechanged from positive into
negative. JSTosound wastransmitted thru theair.The
machine could beoperated bycertain motions ofthe
fingers onalittlepush button which recorded symbols
ontheother machine thatwould reveal themessage
sent. ThePocket Radio made itpossible toconvey
anymessage without any possibility ofdetection be-
cause only theperson sending themessage andtheone
receiving itcould understand orknow anything about
it.Thiswas better than wireless oranyother radio
discovery uptothistime. Robert tested themachine
outbyleaving oneinstrument inWalter's pocket, he
himself going toChicago andconveying messages which
Walter wasable togetwithout anytrouble. Hecould
either speak into this little Pocket Radio andconvey
thesound without anyone elsebeing able totake itfrom
theair,oruse ittoconvey thoughts oremotions. The
testproved perfect andRobert knew thathehadanother
great discovery which would beofgreat value tohis
Government intime ofwar.Hedecided tokeep thisa

secret andhave itready toaidtheUnited States ata
timewhen theywould need itmost.
Robert figured that there would beabigbullcam-
paign incotton during 1929 sohehadstarted buying
early intheyear, expecting abigadvance later. He
had also forecast therapid advance ofcertain classes
ofstocks. During 1928hehadclosed asuccessful bear
campaign inMajor Motors andwas stillholding his
Right Aeroplane stock, which hadcontinued toadvance,
andhefigured that itwould haveabigriseduring 1929.
Hisfortune waspiling uprapidly, despite allthemoney
hewasspending onhisnew inventions. Thenewship
•^Marie, theAngel ofMercy/' wasnowabout perfected,
butRobert intended that thisshould never bemade
known tothepublic until hehad itinperfect working
order and itwasasuccess beyond doubt.
After preparing hiscampaign forthemarket and
buying stocks andcotton forthebigadvance, Walter
noticed agreat change inRobert. Hishealth began to
failagain, andnow thathehadachieved great success
and completed such wonderful inventions, without
Marie tocomfort himhewould probably breakdown in
health andgive up. Robert hadceased totalkmuch
about Marie. His interest inthefuture waswaning.
Walter andEdna, whowere still asmuch inlove as
ever, often discussed Robert's physical condition. They
decided toencourage him togoaway foralong-needed
rest. Walter hadatalkwithRobert inthemiddle of
January, 1929, butRobert didn't showmuch interest
oranydesire totravel.Ashort time after this,Robert
appeared attheofficeonemorning looking morehaggard

240THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
andworn than ever.Hecalled Walter andEdna into
the office, toldthem thathehadhadavery peculiar
dream thenight before, thathehaddreamed thathehad
gone toParis andsuddenly metMarie. Hewas so
strongly impressed with thedream thathedecided to
leave atonce. Told Walter togive themechanics in-
structions toputhisoldship"The St.Marie" inshape
tosail atonce.
Itwasamatter ofonlyacouple ofdays until they
reported that"The St.Marie" wasinperfect shape and
could stand atriparound theworld. There was tobe
agreat convention ofallthenations onaviation inParis
andRobert decided thathewanted tobethere for it,but
themain incentive forthetripwashisdream. Robert
hadnotrouble insecuring letters ofintroduction to
prominent people inLondon andParis. When hesaid
good-bye toWalter andEdna, theywished himGod-
speed, toldhim thattheyhoped hisdream would be-
come areality andthathewould findMarie, butthey
knew thathewasnotthesame Robert ofold.Heacted
asthohisspirit wasbroken. Onthemorning ofFeb-
ruary 2nd, 1929, Robert started hisflight toParis and
arrived there promptly intheevening andwent tovisit
some friends andacquaintances. After talking over
thewarsituation andhisforecasts ofthegreatwaryet
tocome, hedecided tovisitfriends inLondon. England
andRussia werewaging their battles intheairand
doing very little land fighting. Despite thegood start
thatEngland hadmade, Russia andherallies were get-
tingthebestofthevictory. Robert found London very
uninteresting. Uptothistimehehadheard nothing of
Marie anddecided toreturn toParis.

Onabeautiful sunjiiny morning inthelatter partof
Feburary, 1929, Robert waswalking down aprominent
business street inParis withnospecial objective in
mind. Hewasfeeling sickandgloomy andwaswalking
with hisheaddown^ looking atthestreet. Suddenly he
sawaform approaching very closely, andlikeaflash,
awoman quickly passed him.Hewassure itwas
Marie. Hisheartwasinhisthroat. Heturned around
quickly tofollow herbutshehaddisappeared. Just as
shepassed himshedropped aletter onthestreet andhe
picked itup,put itinhispocket andrushed ondown
thestreet, hoping tofind her,butafter exhausting him-
selfrunning around, fighting hiswaythru thecrowds,
without aglimpse ofher,hedecided toopen theletter.
When heopened ititwaswritten inaforeign language
which hedidnotunderstand. Hewasnotsurewhether
itwasMarie's handwriting ornot. His firstthought
was togoimmediately toaninterpreter andhave the
letter read.Onsecond thought, hedecided that itmight
besomething confidential andthathewould gotoan
oldfriend who lived inParis andaskhim tointerpret
theletter. Robert called onLouis Renan, stated thecir-
cumstance ofhismeeting Marie onthestreet andtold
himabout theletter shedropped. Hisfriend gladly
consented toread theletter. Robert handed ittohim
andheglanced over it;handed itback toRobert without
aword, toldhimtogetoutofhishouse immediately and
never darken thedoor again. Robert begged foran
explanation butinvain. Hisfriend wasangry and
determined andpushed Robert outofthedoor. Robert
walked slowly back tohishotel, disappointed, mystified,
andheart-broken. What could bethemeaning ofthis

towhat itcontained ?Hadhereally metMarie andwas

thenext bestplanwas togotoaninterpreter, sohe
inquired atthehotel thename ofaninterpreter andwas
informed where hecould getanylanguage interpreted.
Hecalled attheaddress, explained hismission tothe
manager andturned over theletter. Inafewminutes
themanager returned, handed himtheletter, toldhim
therewasthedoor, please getoutandasknoquestions.
Robert again begged forsome explanation buttheman
wasdefiant andrefused tomake anycomment.
Robert returned tohishotel tothink matters over.
Hebought apaper andlooked overthenewsfrom ITew
Yorkandmarket reports. Hesawthatcotton andstocks
wereadvancing asheexpected, butmoney-making now
wasofnointerest tohimwhen heatlastthought that
hehadfound where Marie was.Hedecided toplace

thathehadpassed heronthestreet, hadfound the let-

thepapers thatafternoon. Received aninvitation from
some acquaintances inParis todinewiththem andgo
toaball.Hewanted torefuse theinvitation because he
didnotfeelequal totheoccasion, butthey insisted that
itwould dohimgoodandbegged him tocome along.
Robert hadbeen sodisappointed about themysterious
letter andthesudden lossofMarie after hehadseen
her,thathedecided tosaynothing about theincident

tohisfriends. After dinner wasover, theychatted with
Robert, andheseemed more cheerful. They toldRobert
oftheAviators' Costume Ball totakeplace intheHotel
Lafayette thatnight andaskedhim togoalong. Rob-
erttried tobegoffandmade theexcuse thathehadno
costume forthis occasion, butthey toldhimthatthey
hadalready ordered oneforhimandtherewasnoget-
tingoutofit—hehadtogo,sofinally heconsented.
When they arrived atthehotel andentered theball-
room, Robert's friends, whoknew ofhisgreatfame in
iN'ewYork andhissuccess inspeculative markets, were
anxious tointroduce him totheprominent menand
women ofParis. Aviators were therefrom alloverthe
world. Theyhadcome forthegreat convention. Each
country wascompeting forthegrand prize forthemost
efficient airplane andthebestonesuited forwarpur-
poses. They asked Robert ifhedidnothave aplane to
enter orifhecould notdemonstrate something with
"The St.Marie." Hetoldthem that hishealth was
notgoodandthathewasnotinterested inentering a
plane atthistime. Theballroom wasdecorated with
everything connected with airplanes. Miniature planes
were flying around theroom, circling upanddownfrom
theceilings. Itwasagorgeous display andwhile itwas
dazzling toothers, Robert paid very little attention to
it.His friends, inorder toplease himandgethim
interested, hadtheradio tuned intoNewYorkandwere
getting music from theBiltmore. Thedance started.
Robert watched butwasvery little interested. His
friends invited him todance butherefused. Hehad
BOthoughts ofanything butMarie. Ashewas sitting,

watching thedancers whirl around thefloor, suddenly
helooked across thehallandagain hesawMarie dressed
likeaneagle, queen ofthe air.Hemade amadrush
thru thecrowd totheother side ofthehallandwhen
hegotthere, hecould seenoMarie. Theordeal was
toomuch forhim.He fellunconscious onthe floor.
Friends rushed tohisassistance andafter reviving him,
heexplained tothem thathehadseenMarie again and
asked them tofindherandbring hertohim. After
investigation, they toldhimthattherewasnoonethere
bythatname andthatnone oftheladies had leftthe
ballroom. They brought them allbefore himandintro-
duced him, butMarie wasnotamong them. Robert
wasnotonly sick atheart butsickphysically, andhis
friends realized itand called anerve specialist, Dr.
Descartes. Robert explained whathadhappened, about
meeting Marie onthestreet andabout seeing heratthe
ball, altho hesaidnothing about themysterious letter
totheDoctor. TheDoctor, afterexamining him, told
hisfriends hethought thathewassuffering frommental
delusions—thathehadprobably hadthiswoman onhis
mind solongandafter dreaming hehadmetherona
street inParis, hadhoped sostrongly thathewould
meet her,hehadbrought himself tobelieve thatshewas
there andhadreally thought thathehadseen her,both
onthestreet andintheballroom, but itwasprobably an
optical delusion andafterhegotbetter hewould realize
thathehadn't seenMarie.
Several days passed before Robert fully recovered.
Inthemeantime, hehadbecome quite friendly with
Dr.Descartes andtoldhimagreat dealabout hishis-

tory. TheDoctor wasverymuch interested andhad
agreat desire tohelphim. Robert finally decided to
confide inhimabout themysterious letter. TheDoctor
hadabrother in'NewYorkandwasgoing togiveRobert
aletter ofintroduction tohimupon hisreturn. While
theywere onthesubject oftheletter ofintroduction,
Robert toldhim about themysterious letter andthe
Doctor agreed togetafriend ofhiswhocould interpret
it,toread theletter forhim. Robert wasveryhappy
because hethought that ifhecould getthemeaning of
theletter itwould throw some lightonwhat thetrouble
waswithMarie. While hehadbeen sick, hismindhad
wandered andhehadimagined allkinds ofthings, and
forafewmoments, doubted Marie. Heeven thought
thatshemight haveturned outtobeabadwoman and
wasnow inParis, having agaytime, butassoon as
hismind returned toitsnormal state, hisoldfaith in
Marie returned, andheloved herasofoldandbelieved
thatshecould donowrong.
ThenextdayDr.Descartes called, tookRobert with

hehanded the letter back toRobert, turned tothe
Doctor, and said, ^'Have younomore respect formy

TheDoctor begged foranexplanation andRobert of-

After hehadgotten himinhisroomandmadehimcom-
fortable, hebegged Robert nottoworry about theletter,
toldhimthathewould think thematter overand call
andseehimthenext day.
Robert wasverymuch worried. Hishopewas fast
giving way todespair. Heagain realized thathope
deferred maketh theheart grow sick.Hethought of
Henry Watson's story andwondered ifhewould have
togothru lifeanddiewithout everagain seeing Marie.
Dr.Descartes called thefollowing dayand w^asvery
solicitous ofRobert's welfare. Toldhim toforget the
incident about theletter andadvised Robert totryto
getitinterpreted when hereturned to"NewYork. Rob-
erttoldhimmore about Marie's disappearance and
showed himthenotethatMarie hadplaced inhispocket
onthetrain toSt.Louis. TheDoctor read itandsaid
itcertainly leftroom forhope, andwhile itwasmys-
terious, hefeltthatMarie fully intended atsome time
tocome back tohim. Robert hadreceived noreply
tohispersonal notices intheParis newspapers andde-
cided toreturn toISTewYork inafewdays.
Intheearly partofMarch alotoftheaviators were
returning from Paris toISTewYork after theconvention
andRobert decided togohome with them. They in-
sisted thathewasnotphysically able tosail"The St.

wasuneventful andonMarch 5thRobert arrived in
"New York. Onhisarrival hewent immediately tohis
officeandlaboratories where hefound Walter andEdna

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 247
glad toseehim. They toldhim thathelooked much
improved inhealth. Herelated allhisexperiences in
Paris andthemysterious letter. Walter wasverymuch
amazed andatalosstounderstand itall.Hecould not
understand, ifMarie haddropped the letter and
had really seenEobert onthestreet and atthe hall,
why shewould notanswer hispersonal notices inthe
papers and atleast clearupthemystery ofherdisap-
pearance. Robert decided togoimmediately toanin-
terpreter in!N'ewYork andseeifhecould getthemys-
terious letter read. After handing ittothemanwho
spoke about ten different languages, theinterpreter
handed itback tohimandstated inafirm, gentleman-
likemanner thathewould likehim toplease leave the
office immediately andnever return. Robert went at
once tohisofficeandtoldWalter andEdna whathad
happened. They talked itoverandadvanced allkinds
oftheories about what theletter might contain, and
asked Robert ifanyoftheinterpreters hadevergiven
anyinformation orstated whether they could read the
letter ornot. Robert toldthem theyhad not.Edna
thought thatprobably theletter contained amessage to
theinterpreter nottogiveanyinformation ortoreveal
what itcontained toRobert oranyone else. Walter
thought ifthiswere thecase, thatsome oftheinterpreters
whoseemed tobeinsulted byit,would haveimmediately
destroyed theletter instead ofhanding itback tohim.
Themore theories theyadvanced, thelessplausible the
mystery seemed. Robert decided towrite toafamous as-

CHAPTER XXI
ROBERT wasverymuch encouraged bythis letter
because hehadgreat confidence inAstrology and
inthisman's ability. Hedecided togoimmediately
toFlorida forarestand visit allthebeautiful spots
andwatering places thathecould find,hoping toget
somenews ofMarie. Going directly toPalm Beach,
Florida, hemetsome friends ofConan Doyle's who
were verymuch interested inspiritualism. They told
him that afamous spiritualist, Lady Bersford from
England, hadbeen there, andthatthey believed she
could help solve theproblem. Robert asked where he
could findherandwastoldthatshehadgone toOcala,
Florida, tovisit Silver Springs and investigate the
legend ofSilver Springs, thestory about abeautiful
young girlwhodrowned herself intheSprings.
ALegend
(The following story combines theaccuracies offact
with theromance offiction. Aunt Silly lived atSilver
Springs until herdeath, about sixteen years ago,and
wasseenbymanywho visited theSprings. Itisfrom
thegifted penofMrs.Maley Bainbridge Crist) :
Near Florida's celebrated Silver Springs livesanoldnegress,
known totheentire surrounding country as"Aunt Silly,"
whose claim tobeing 110years old isborne outbyherap-

pearance. Aunt Silly iswrinkled anddecrepit, andthewool
peeping from herbandanaed head iswhite assnow, while the
blackness andweirdness ofherface isintensified byaheavy
crop ofsnow-white beard. Aslong astheoldest citizen of
Ocala canremember Aunt Silly haslooked justasancient as
shedoesnow; identified always with Silver Springs, and
hobbling about themfrommorning until night, leaning upon
hershort, thick staff.
That shewasaparticipant inatragedy isknown only toa
veryfewofOcala's oldest citizens, andseldom referred toby
anyofthem. Inthenear vicinity ofOcala, when first itwas
settled, stood asplendid oldmansion owned byCapt. Harding
Douglass, aSouth Carolinian ofconsiderable wealth. Hisonly
childwasason,who,with hismother's beauty ofcountenance,
hadinherited hertender, shrinking nature, and, like herself,
wasaslave totheoldman's iron will. Inthebeautiful little
City ofOcala lived Bernice Mayo, whose blond beauty won,
atfirst sight, theheart ofClaire Douglass. Although ofVir-
ginia ancestry, Bernice wasatrue child ofthe"Land of
Flowers," passionate andimpulsive. Hereyeswere blueand
clear asthewaters ofLake Munroe, beside which shehad
spent herchildhood, inthefair little City ofSanford. Her
hairwas asgolden asFlorida's own sunshine, andFlorida's
tropical splendor ranriotinherblood. For sixmonths Ber-
niceMayo andClaire Douglass were constant companions, and
Silver Springs was their favorite resort. Forhalfaday at
atime theywould drift about onthebosom ofthesplendid,
placid curiosity ofnature.
Bernice seemed never totireofgoing intothedepths ofthe
subterranean world. "IfIwereamermaid, Claire," shewould
say,"and lived inyon crystal cavern, andsome fairday I
should wander forthamong thepalmettos andmosses ofthe
springs, and, sitting onyonder ledge ofrocks, should *comb
mygolden hairwithashell,' andyour boatshould come drift-
ingby,andyouwere toseemeinthewater beneath, would

with hiskisses, andpledge toher hiseternal love asthey
drifted over thetransparent mirror ofwater, pausing now
andthen tostudy therocks and shells, themosses, palmettos,
the fish,which were asvisible eighty feetbelow thetrans-
parent water aswere thetrees andwoodland about them.
There isnothing fairer than Ocala's "Lover's Lane," andyet
nospot held fortheseyoung people theattraction ofSilver
Springs, their constant trysting place. Buttherecame afatal
day, destined toseparate them.Adaywherein Claire Doug-
lassdeclared tohisfather hislove forbeautiful, penniless
Bemice Mayo, and hisdetermination tomake herhiswife.
Stormily, hisfather vowed itshould never be,and secretly
planned aseparation.
When Claire Douglass hadbeen speedily dispatched abroad
onimportant business forhisfather, then itwasthatBernice
learned thetruth, andherproud, delicate nature laycrushed
andbleeding beneath thecruel blowand stillmore cruel sep-
aration.
Vainly shestrove torally; alllifeseemed butanempty
blank toher.Ayeardragged wearily by,andthescenes fre-
quented bymerry Bemice Mayo knew hernomore. Paler
andthinner shedaily grew. Fragile, shewas, asthewhite
blossoms ofherwell-loved springs. The little chain ofgold
that Claire hadlocked onherarmwould have slipped across
thewasted, transparent hand, butfortheribbon that held its
links. Oneday (her lastupon earth) the girl,bydint of
desperate energy, crept toSilver Springs. Even Aunt Silly
wasunprepared forthewhite, emaciated little creature who
tottered intohercabin and fellfainting inherarms. Con-
sciousness soon returned, but itwasapparent even totheold
blackwoman thatdeath had set itsgray, unmistakable seal
upon theyoung face.
"Aunt Silly," gasped the girl, "Ihavecome toyoutodie,
andyoumust obeymylastrequest; thegrave divulges no
secrets. Ere tonight's sun sets Ishall beinheaven. This
separation from theman Ilovehasbeenmydeath, butinthat
deathweshall beunited. Ihave asked God,andHehasheard

me;you willdoasIask. Tonight when themoon comes out,
rowmybody toBoiling Springs, andburymethere. You
know thespot—make nomistake. Dothis,andGod willattend

^'Good Gord A'mighty, chile,youthinkAunt Sillyamgwine
totedadebody offinthelonesomely night?" asked theold
woman, hervery teeth chattering with thesuperstitious fear
peculiar toherrace. The girlrealized theriskofherplan
being thwarted, andraising herself toasitting posture she
seized theoldwoman's hands and fixed herdying eyes full
onherface.
"Aunt Silly," shegasped, "Iamadyingwoman ;Iamvery
near toGod; Ihave talked withHim, andHehasanswered
me.Mywillhasbeen crushed inlife, Iswear itshall notin
death. Before twenty-four hours Claire Douglass shall join
meinthecrystal cavern ofSilver Springs. Ifyoudonot

request, orwillyourefuse me,andreap theprophecy ofa
dying woman, which shall restupon your cowardly head for

Theoldwoman wasshaking likeanaspen. Hereyes pro-
truded with fear,andgreat beads ofperspiration rolled down
hercheeks. Thestrength ofthedying girl's willhadpre-
vailed, andtheoldwoman answered: "Ipromises, honey; I
promises."
Itwasasolemn andawful sight that night, witnessed alone
byGodandnature; theboat, which drifted down Silver
Springs inthemoonlight, bearing itstwostrange occupants—
theoneweird, bent, grotesque; theother, sosilent, sowhite,
sopathetic, initsdead loveliness. Notaleafwas stirring,
notasound heard, butthesplash, splash oftheoldwoman's
oars, asherboat, with itsstrange, beautiful burden, drifted
over thecurious, transparent body ofwater; drifted until it

reached Boiling Springs, then veered about andstood still.
Gently and easily, asifithadbeen ababe, theoldwoman
lifted the little body. Something ofherfearhaddeparted
intheplacid smile ofthedead face. Tears rolled down her
dusky face asshebentforward inobedience tothegirl's curi-
ousrequest. Foramoment thebody rocked toandfroon
thebosom ofthewater, upon which itshappiest moments had
been spent. Thedead face smiled, andthewealth ofhair
gleamed inthemoonlight likeasheen ofgold. Every pebble
was visible inthedepths below. Suddenly, asifbymagic,
thebodybegan sinking. Theboiling ofthespring hadceased,
showing apeculiar little fissure intherockfrom whence all
thestrange body ofwater came. The fissure slowly divided,
received thedeadbodyandclosed again, shutting every vestige
ofitfrom view.
"Gord A'mighty, dat chile aangel sho' nuff. Shemus'

muttered theoldwoman, assherowed back tohercabin inthe
moonlight.
Amocking-bird ontheopposite shore sentforth aflood of
silvery melody. "Hear datnow," muttered Aunt Silly; "dat
birddone sendin' forth deweddin' song o'debridegroom.
Come on,Claire Douglass, yo' little brideamwaitin' foryou
more pacifyin' denshewaited many along day."
Thedayfollowing thedeath ofBemice Mayo wasone
never tobeforgotten bythecitizens ofOcala. Claire Doug-
lasshadjustreturned after ayear's absence. Hefound his
beautiful cousin (whom hisfather desired tobecome hiswife)
aguest atthehome ofhisparents.
"Claire," said hisfather asthey lingered over thebreak-
fast table, "Ihave afine,new skiff atSilver Springs, andI
wishyoutotakeyour cousin forarow thismorning; and,
bythepermission ofyouyoung people, Ishallmake oneof

"Delightful, uncle," cried the girl; and Claire, while he
turned atrifle pale atthethought ofreturning tothespot

where allthathadgiven color tohis lifehad transpired,
could only acquiesce.
Claire Douglass looked unusually handsome astheparty
drifted down Silver Springs intheApril sunshine, butthere
wasacurious pallor onhisface,andtheuncle andniece were
left tocarry onalltheconversation. What acontrast the
blooming girlinApril sunshine bore totheoneinthesolemn

alittle boathovering over it.Theboatwasrowed byAunt
Silly; and itsother occupant wasanoldwoman, whose eyes
were swollen withweeping. The skiffpaused beside the little
rowboat, andtheoccupants ofeach gazed into thecurious,
transparent depths below.
Suddenly theniece cried out, ''Oh, see,that looks likea
hand; alittlehuman hand!" Plainer andmore visible it
grew, the little white hand with itsgoldchain locked above the
slender wrist. Ah, little hand, Claire Douglass would have
known youamong tenthousand hands! Hisfacewaswhite
asdeath andhegasped asthough choking. Allwere intent
upon thescene below. Suddenly theboiling ofthewater
ceased, andoutupon arock initstransparent depths, likea

even theheart ofthemother, who forthelasttime inlife
gazed upon thedead faceofherchild, Claire Douglass dashed
overboard, diving deeper, ever deeper, until hecaught inhis
arms the little figure ofhisdead love.
Then oncemore therock divided and closed, shutting from

CHAPTER XXII
ROBERT wasgreatly impressed with thisstory and
what they toldhimabout thewonderful powers
ofLady Bersford. After consulting with hisfriends,
hedecided togoimmediately toSilver Springs tosee
her.OnSunday morning about 10o'clock heboarded
alocal airplane forSilver Springs andarrived inthe
afternoon. Itwasafitting setting forthescene. The
daywasbeautiful, thesunshine atitsbest. Robert had
watched theplane asitflewswiftly across thecountry.
Hehadviewed themany beautiful orange groves and
thought ofthewonderful work ofthehand ofNature
inpainting beauty grander thananyhand ofmancould
ever do.Here hethought ofsomething thathewould
write ofMarie incontrast toherbeauty.
After thoughts ofMarie's beauty had flitted thru
Robert's brain andhisdream andhope forMarie had
revived, hewasfeeling hopeful andenthusiastic. Lady
Bersford upon receiving theletter ofintroduction from
herfriends, greeted Robert withunusual courtesy. He
toldhisstory. Shelistened attentively andwhen hehad
finished telling herabout themysterious letter, shesaid
thatthere wasaninterpreter atthehotelwhounder-
stood mostanyforeign language andthatshewassure
hecould interpret the letter. Robert was elated be-
causeLady Bersford showed such agreat interest and

desire tohelphim.Herelated alltheobstacles hehad
metwith intrying togettheletter interpreted before,
andhadalmost losthope ofevergetting itinterpreted.
Sheassured himthatherfriendship with theinterpreter
would atthistime bring results.
Robert wasanxious toseeSilver Springs andLady
Bersford wasanxious forhim togoandsee itimmedi-
ately andsaid that after their return shewould see
theinterpreter andgetthemysterious letter read. They
went totheSprings andslowly rodeoutonthebeautiful
waters. Robert hadheard thestory andwhen theboat
slowly came toastopover"The Bridal Chamber'' and
hesawtheface ofabeautiful woman intherocks his
heart almost failed him.Hethought ofthesorrows
hehadgone thruandwondered ifsuch afatemight
havebeen Marie's. Thebeautiful waters reflected the
most radiant colors Robert hadever seen inhis life.
Hesecretly prayed thegreatest prayer ofhis life, that
hemight meetMarie hereandwith allofherbeauty,
where they could enjoy thebeauty ofnature together.
When helooked thru thetransparent waters intothe
bridal chamber^ itbrought himback toSunday morn-
ing,June 5,1927, when hehadexpected tomarry
Marie. Tears streamed down hischeeks andLady Bers-
ford realizing thesituation andknowing thatshecould
say little, remained insilence until Robert's emotions
hadpassed. Then shetoldofheradmiration forhis
loveanddevotion toMarie andsaid that ascene like
this, painted bythehand ofJ^ature wascalculated to
melt theheart ofthemost cold-blooded manonearth.
Robert asked themanwhowasrowing theboat torow

back totheplace where theface ofthespirit bride
showed inthewater andashelooked down attheface
again, hethought ofMarie and this iswhat hesaid:
''Most beautiful faceinalltheworld^ bestbeloved eyes
thatinspired thebestinme,thedays passbyonleaden
wings, when only inmemory your dear eyesshine for
me.'' Somehow thebeautiful waters andthescenery
inspired anewhope inRobert, forlovemust ever in-
spire hope inmanwhen hisfaith inawoman keeps
thelovelight burning onthealtar ofhisheart.
Robert andLady Bersford returned tothe hotel.
After dinner, Lady Bersford metRobert andtoldhim
thatshehadfound theinterpreter andhehadagreed
toread themysterious letter that evening. Robert,
having metwith somany disappointments, feltthathe
mustmake sure thistimehewould gettheletter read.
Hemettheinterpreter, went overthewhole story with
him, toldhimthatnomatter what theletter contained,
good orbad,hemustknow thetruth andnothing but
thetruth. Saidhewould payanysum that thein-

would agree toread theletter regardless ofwhat itcon-

sawthat hisheart wasbreaking andtoldhim thatno

theletter asthedesire torelieve anhonest, loyal heart
which wasbreaking foragreat love. Suchmen ashe
wasourcountry's need intime ofperilandsuch loyalty
anddevotion toawoman wasfound inbutfewmen;
that itseemed more divine than real,andthathewould
interpret theletter gladly andwillingly. When Robert

wasfully assured atthistime thatthere would beno
disappointment, hewassupremely happy. Hegrabbed
thehand ofLady Bersford, thanked her,and fellupon
hisknees before theinterpreter andthanked him in
advance forhispromise tointerpret theletter.
'^^N'ow letusdelay nolonger," said theinterpreter,
"givemetheletter andIwillread it/' Robert had
always carried theletter inawallet inhispocket, never
letting itgetoutofhispossession. Had itcarefully
folded upinsome other papers. Hepulled forth the
wallet from hispocket, opened itupandlooked forthe
letter. Itwasnotthere. Hesearched thewallet care-
fully buttherewasnomistake about it.The letter was
gone. Thedisappointment wasanother great blow to
him.Hetalked thematter overwith theinterpreter
andLady Bersf ordandwasatalosstounderstand how
theletter could have disappeared from hispocket. Was
sure thathehad itwhen hewasinPalm Beach. He
telegraphed thehotel inPalm Beach andaftermaking a
search, they reported thattheywere unable tofindthe
letter. Lady Bersford realized thekeendisappointment
thatthelossofthismysterious letterhadbrought Robert,
soshetoldhimthatshewould useherspiritual powers
everywaypossible tosolve themystery oftheletter and
trytohelphim findMarie, andthat ifhewould leave
heralone insilence that night, thefollowing dayshe
would report tohimtheinformation shereceived.
Robert arose early thenextmorning anddecided that
hewould gotoSilver Springs andseethis beautiful

songs ofthebirds, watched thebeautiful fishrunning
toandfrointheclear waters. Heagain thought ofthe
story ofthespirit bridewhom thelegend saidappeared
upon thewaters onmoonlight nights. Hismind went
back tothefishing trip atSpirit Lake, Arkansas. He
thought ofthestory ofSpirit Lakeandhowhewasim-
pressed asachildwith that story. ISTow itseemed more
vivid and real. Hismind reverted back tothedeath
ofHenry Watson andhethought ^'Is itmyfate tovisit
places and tohear stories oftragedy anddisappoint-
ment oflovers, andintheend, willmyfatebelike
theirs? Must Isink intothewaters offorgetfulness
without ever again seeing thebestbeloved face inall
theworld, Marie's ?After all, isitlikeHenry Watson
said: 'Hope isbutananchor tothe soul, butfacts
arestubborn things andwemust facethemV"Fora
moment, Robert feltthathehadbeen clinging tohope
allthese years andhewasalmost ready tobidhope

knew that ifhope should depart andnothold aloft a
light ofMarie's love,heatthatmoment would follow

awaiting him.Heatehisbreakfast hurriedly
andretired toasecret corner inthehotel where they
would bealone andhecould hearwhatLady Bersford
hadgathered from thespirit world thenight before.
Her firstwords when heentered theroom were, "Mr.
Gordon, Ihavegoodnews foryouandIknow thatyou
candepend on it.Last night aspirit appeared thatI
hadnever seenorheard before. ItwasanIndian girl,
named ^Laughing Waters,' whosaidshewasthedaugh-

already seenandloved Chuleotah, therenewed chief ofatribe
which dwelt among thewild groves ofSilver Springs. But
itwasasadtruth thatbetween theoldchief andtheyoung
chief, and their tribes, there hadlongbeen adeadly feud.
They were enemies. When Okeehumkee learned thatChuleo-
tahhadgained theaffections ofhisbeloved child, notmany
weeks passed away before thenoble Chuleotah was slain. Slain,
too,bythefather. Dead! Her lover dead! Poor child.
Will shereturn tothepaternal lodge anddwell among her
people while herfather's hand isstained with thedrippings
ofherlover's scalp? No. She hurries away tothewell-
known fountain. Itwasafavorite spot, where herself and
Chuleotah metontheglassy bottom oftheSprings. The
pale ghost ofChuleotah stands beckoning hertocome. All
was stillsave thenight winds that sighed andmoaned thru
thelofty pines. Thencame thegirltothesideoftheSprings.
Foramoment shepaused upon theedge oftheSprings, then
metherpalms above herhead, and,withawild leap, she fell
into thewhelming waves. Shehadgone tooneofthose
enchanted isles, faroutintheWestern Seas,where themaiden
andherlover areunited, andwhere bothhavefound another

Lady Bersford said thatLaughing Waters' spirit
toldherthat after shedrowned herself andherspirit
wasreleased, shehadbeenveryhappy infinding others
whometdisappointment inloveandhelping torelieve
their sufferings andbring about anunderstanding and

until Marie's spirit^ which hadalways been closely in

because Robert needed some hopeandencouragement
togoonandwait until theproper timewhen Marie
would return tohim. Themysterious letter never ex-

theadepts ofIndia. Some ofmytribeknewhow to
project thesubconscious mind, orspirit, assome called

hadreceived impressions solongandhehadhoped and
desired solong foraletter from Marie, thatwhen her
spirit appeared heexpected amessage, aletter, orsome
communication, andhereally thought shedropped a
letter. Thispower sostrongly impressed thesubcon-

After this,Robert wasmucli more cheerful andhope-

right track. Hethought ofthelaws laiddown inthe
Bible; remembered what Jesus saidwhen they asked
himforasignthattheSonofmanwould remain three
daysandthree nights intheheart oftheearth, then
riseandascend toheaven. Robert knew themeaning
ofthis.Heknew that sorrows, sufferings anddisap-
pointment had tocome before joyandhappiness; for
every dayofsunshine comes anight ofdarkness, for
every aching intheheart there isareturning flow.
That allthelaws ofNature taught theeternal lawof
action and reaction. Hetook great comfort inthis;
knew thatthepromise was laiddown intheBible of
great reward forloveandfaithfulness andhefeltvery
happy because hebelieved ^^Laughing Waters' "story

Robert remained afewdays longer atSilver Springs.
Enjoyed being withLady Bersford andtoldherofhis
understanding oftheBible andnatural laws. Shesaid

When Robert prepared todepart from Silver Springs,
hisheart was filled with gratitude, forLady Bersford

averywealthy woman, with alarge estate inEngland;
thatshehadgone into thiswork atthesolicitation of
SirArthur Conan Doyle, forthegood thatshecould do
forothers andnotforanymonetary consideration. Her
reward forbeing unselfish andtrying tohelphimwas
hisappreciation, shesaid. This attitude onthepart of
Lady Bersford wasagreat comfort toRobert andgave
himmore faith intheBible. Heknew that thelaw
that"whatsoever aman soweth, heshall alsoreap" was
adivine lawandanatural law,thatnomancould break
itorevade it,andthat hisreward wasjust assure as
thelawwasinevitable. HehadreadEmerson's "Essay
onCompensation," andstrongly believed that.Hesaid
toLady Bersford, "Your reward issure, because you
aredoing right, giving outthebestyoucan tohelp
others, andonlygood willreturn toyou."
Lady Bersford said,"Thank youverymuch, Mr.
Gordon, Ihave enjoyed our visits andhope thatwe
willmeet again some time.May Iaskwhere youare
going from here?" "Iamgoing direct toIsTewYork
asIhave important business matters tolook after
there," hereplied. ^'Mr. Gordon, you don't look

going from liere toSebring, Florida. Have heard so
many stories ofthiswonderful place that Iwant to

asked Robert. Lady Bersford said,"Iunderstand there
isasunshine sanitarium there. They teach youhow

ofFlorida; infact, oneofthefewplaces inFlorida
where youcangetgood drinking water. Theclimate is

and feltthat itwastheplacePonce deLeonwaslooking

anyother place inFlorida. Imadeupmymind that
Iwould never leave Florida before Ivisited thiswon-

Robert wasverymuch impressed withLady Ber&-
ford's report onSebring anddecided that itmust be
theideal place foratired business man togoandenjoy
thesports andrecoup hishealth. Ittookvery little
persuading onthepart ofLady Bersford togetRobert
togotoSebring with her.
OnMarch 2Tth,Lady Bersford andRobert Gordon
arrived inSebring, Florida. They found everything
just ashadbeen described byherfriends. Theclimate

I!N"thelatter part ofApril, Robert decided that lie
must return toISTewYork andtakeuphisduties.
Hesaidgood-bye toLady Bersford. Was profuse in
histhanks; assured herthatheowed heragreat debt
ofgratitude forthecomforting messages thatshehad
brought tohimthru"Laughing Waters'' andabove all
wasunder lasting obligation forthegreat kindness she
hadrendered inbringing him toSebring where hehad
fully regained hishealth. Sheassured himthat itwas
arealpleasure tohertohavebeen ofservice and in-
vitedhim tovisit herestate inEngland onhisnext
trip over.
AsRobert started toward ISTew York, hisheart was
light, hishopes were revived andhehadgreater faith
than ever thatMarie was aliveandwould inthenot
distant future return tohim.When hearrived in!N"ew
York hewent direct tohisofficeandlaboratory. Walter
andEdna greeted himwith enthusiasm. Were happy
toseehimlooking sowell. Walter grabbed both of
Robert's hands and said,"Old pal,Ihave never seen
youlooking sowell.Youmust havefound Ponce de
Leon's fountain ofeternal youth while youwere in
Florida." Robert replied, "Icertainly did.Hadsome
W^onderful experience atSilver Springs, themost beau-

while there Iheard about themost wonderful health

When Robert hadfinished telling about thebeauties
ofFlorida, Walter acted bashful andEdna looked rather
sheepish. Then Walter said, "Robert, wehave abig
surprise foryou.Edna andIaregoing tobemarried
inJune." "Well, this isquite asurprise," saidRobert,
"but Iknew itwould come sooner orlater. Youmust

discovery wasaperfectly harmless gastobeused in

something touseinwarwhich would notdestroy human
livesandhewasverymuch elated overWalter's dis-

andthatEdna hadsuchconfidence inhim, shehadtaken

CHAPTER XXy
I]SrtheFall of1929, Eobert andWalter made a
largeamount ofmoney incotton andwheat. Rob-
ertwasunusually happy. Altho over three years had
passed without any direct news ofMarie hewassure
shewas alive; feltthatthetimewasnotlong towait
before shewould reappear. Thewarclouds hadbegun
toappear asRobert hadpredicted. Spain andJapan
were threatening theUnited States. Controversies
over airplane airports arose. Japan hadforbidden the
United States conmaercial ships toland onher soil.
Diplomatic relations were notsmoothing affairs outand
Robert knew thatwarwasinevitable. Spain hadmade
rapid progress with airplanes andwasanxious totry
herpower against theUnited States. TheUnited
States Government waswaking uptothefactoftheir
need ofagreater airfleetandtheAirDepartment was
making some great progress. Robert knew theywere
working onsecret plans andknew thathehadsome-
thing thatcould beused successfully attheright time.
Hewasspending money lavishly andworking toim-
prove onhisEzekiel plane. Hewaskeeping every-
thing secret, sending outplans todifferent manufac-
turers andhaving theparts made, Walter andhimself
secretly putting themachine together. Robert hadmade

campaign inoilstocks hadbeen brought about bythe
decreasing oilsupply. TheGovernment realizing the
increased demand forgasoline onaccount ofthelarge
amount ofairplanes used,knew that intime ofwar
their success would depend upon thesupply ofoiland
gas,soadecree waspassed conserving theoilresources.
There was stillabigforeign demand foroilandgaso-
line aswarinEurope was stillgoing on. Affairs in
England were inabad state and revolution was
threatened.
April, 1930
Japan declared warontheUnited States andSpain
joined forces with her.They secured theaidofMexico
andestablished anairbase there. TheUnited States
wasunprepared forwar astheyhadnotkeptupthe
programme ofbuilding asufficient airfleet toprotect
thecountry against invasion bysuch alarge fleet as
commanded byJapan andSpain. There wasahasty
callbytheGovernment forvolunteers totheAviation
Corps. Robert Gordon andWalter Kennelworth has-
tened toWashington, tendered their services tothe
Government andjoined theAviation Corps. Theywere
made Lieutenants andordered immediately toSan
Antonio, Texas, where theSouthern Aviation Division
had itsheadquarters. Robert offered thebenefit ofhis
experience tothe officials^ butolder andwiser heads
refused tolisten tohisadvice because theythought he
wastooyoung. Atthattimetheyknew nothing about
hislong years ofsecret workandhisgreat inventions,
butthey soon learned thevalue ofhisdiscovery and

patent which hehadsold toJapan,—themuffler which
made theairplane silent.
TheUnited States Government fearing thatJapan
would make the firstattack onthePacific Coast either
around LosAngeles orSanFrancisco, rushed thebattle
fleet tothePacific. Thisproved tobeoneofthegreat-
estmistakes ofthewar. Assoon asthebattleships
cruised intothePacific, Japan attacked from theair
with their noiseless airplanes andbegan dropping deadly
bombs from great heights. The anti-aircraft gunsfrom
thedecks ofthebattleships were powerless toreach
thebombing planes atsuch great heights. Defeat was
swift andsevere andonlyafewofthebattleships es-
caped complete destruction from the first attack. The
United States Ofiicers hadfound that theJapanese
planes could risemore than twice thealtitude ofthe
United States planes. Theyknew thatJapan hadsome
invention thatwassuperior toourswhich enabled them
toreach such great heights that their airships were
practically immune from attack. This placed the
United States atagreat disadvantage astheywere un-
able toprotect thecoast citiesfrom being destroyed by
bombs from theJapanese planes.
Acouncil ofwarwasheld. Thecommanding officers
were called together. ThePresident hastily summoned
theCabinet. There wasnominimizing thedanger for
everyone knew thattheingenuity ofJapan haddesigned
asuperior fighting plane ;that thiswastobeawarin

were obsolete ;thattheUnited States mustmove quick

They decided toconfiscate thelarge manufacturing
plants and startthem onmaking new inventions and
themanufacture ofairplanes. Central Steelwascon-
fiscated; alsoMajor Motors andMajor Electric Co,
Thewarcouncil decided thattheyshould scatter their
airforces from Brownsville, Texas, uptoElPaso to
protect theRioGrande from attack thruMexico ;that
thebattle lineshould extend uptheColorado River on
across toPortland and Seattle. Theland forces were
allrushed totheCoast, forming abattle linefrom
Brownsville, Texas, across tothe!N"orthwest toSeattle.
Itwasdecided that thislineshould beheldwith reserve
forces tobesent tosupport asecond line ofdefense
running fromSanDiego uptheCoast toPortland, to
protect inland invasion bythefoeincasetheywere suc-
cessful incapturing anyofthecoast cities. People
inLosAngeles andSanFrancisco were inastate of
turmoil. Thousands were leaving every daybytrain
andairplane, going totheGrand Canyon where there
werenocities andtheyhoped theywould besafefrom
attacks. Others went tothecentral andeastern parts
oftheUnited States because they feared attacks any
day.
Japan wasquick tofollow uphervictory gained on
thewater byattacking LosAngeles from theairinthe
middle ofMay.Here again thegreat value ofthesilent
motor wasproved andtheheight towhich theJapanese
plane could rise. Astheenemy stole over thecityin

andtheskyscrapers crumbled topieces. Every street
lightwasordered out,leaving thecityintotal darkness.
Thepeople were aroused atthefirstnoise ofexploding
bombs andrushed outtofindthecityindarkness. This
caused apanic. Army officers tried toquiet thepeople
andkeepthem intheirhomes because they realized the
danger ifthey rushed outintothestreets where the
bombs were falling. Powerful searchlights were sweep-
ingtheskyinaneffort tolocate theinvading planes.
Then thegiant aircraft gunswere trained ontheenemy,
butthedistance wassogreat andtheplanes moving so
swiftly, that theywere unable todomuch damage.
They onlysucceeded inbringing down three ofthebomb-
ingplanes. TheUnited States scouting planes were
sent outimmediately, followed bythefighting planes
carrying 6-inch guns. They found that theJapanese
planes were dropping bombs from aheight of60,000
to80,000 feetandtheUnited States planes wereunable
torisehighenough toattack them.
Thebattle waged thruout thenight andwhen thesun
rosethenextmorning, thebeautiful cityofLosAngeles
wasinruins. Thousands ofpeople hadbeen killed and
themost oftheimportant buildings hadbeen destroyed.
Thepeople ofLosAngeles weremore excited than they
hadeverbeenduring earthquakes. Thedestruction and
lossoflifewere sogreat thateveryone forgot allabout
their property andmoney andonlythought ofsaving
their livesandprotecting their loved ones. Thecom-

itwasdecided that toforce thepeople toremain meant

valuable property, sotheonlything todowas tomove
thepeople outasfast aspossible andsurrender the
city. After thecommanders hadheld this council,
news oftheir decision wasconveyed tothesubordinate
officers.
Lieutenant Gordon's heart wasbroken when hereal-
ized that thebeautiful city ofLosAngeles must be
either surrendered ordestroyed^ yetheknew thatunless
theGovernment quickly made somenewandwonderful
inventions, many more defeats were instore. When
Captain George Cooper whowasincommand ofLieu-
tenant Gordon's company, received orders thatnomove
wastobemade andnoscouts tobesentoutuntil further
instructions, hecalled Lieutenants Gordon andKennel-
worth andconveyed tothem theorders. Lieutenant
Gordon wasdesperate. Hewanted todosomething to
help save thesituation, buttooffer hisadvice tohis
superior officers was futile. Finally, hedecided todis-
obey orders andgooutonascouting expedition alone
andseewhat hecould find out.Hethought hemight

Heimmediately turned hisplane andrushed back

hisplane around quickly andcharged theJapanese
plane. The fight lasted forseveral minutes.
After Lieutenant Gordon hadbeengonesome time
andfailed toreturn Lieutenant Kennelworth knowing
thathehaddisobeyed orders andgone outwith his

andthathetoomust disobey orders andgotohisrescue.
Hejumped into afastplane and sailed out,going
direct toward SanDiego. Hesoon sighted thetwo
planes incombat andjustbefore hereached thescene,
theywentdown together. Hisheart sankwithin him.
Heknew itwas hisoldfriend Robert andfeared for
theworst. Landing along theside ofthewreck he
found thattheJapanese aviator hadbeen killed. Rob-
ert's leghadbeenbroken ;otherwise hewasuninjured.
Hequickly hauled him aboard hisown plane and
started back forheadquarters andwas justintime as
other Japanese planes were approaching andfollowed
him close intoLosAngeles. Lieutenant Gordon was
confined tothehospital three orfourweeks before his
leghealed andhefully recovered. Hewasgiven a
severe reprimand fordisobeying orders butbecause he
hadbrought down anenemy plane theGovernment
madehimaCaptain forthisbravery andalsopromoted
Lieutenant Kennelworth, hischum, tothesame rank.
Inthemeantime, thepeople hadbeenmoved away
fromLosAngeles asfastaspossible. There hadbeen sev-

outnumbered bytheSpanish andJapanese airforces.
England wasthreatening tojoinforces withJapan and
Spain. Anattack onSanFrancisco wasexpected at
anyhour. People wanted togetaway andmove east
intothemountains forprotection, buttheGovernment
had notified everyone toremain. The fact that the
foreign planes were noiseless puttheUnited States at
agreat disadvantage. Robert andWalter were using
their secret radio tocommunicate with each other.
They hadoffered thisinvention totheGovernment and
ithadbeen accepted. Thiswasagreat help astheJap-

mean thelossofthousands oflives, which would prove
useless, butthatpart oftheairforcewould have tobe
sent intoMexico toprotect thearmy and thiswould
weaken thecoast patrol andgivetheenemy achance to
make anairattack onother coast cities. Admiral
Dawson said that intheweakened condition ofthe
I^avy, since thedisaster from thefirstattack bytheJap-
anese planes, itwould befoolhardy toattempt anyag-
gressive campaign bytheNavy, thatwhat ships theyhad
werenow scattered along theSouthern, Eastern and
Western shores forprotection and toconcentrate them
atonepointwould onlyweaken other joints fromwhich
theywould have tobewithdrawn. General Marshall
wasoftheopinion thatthebestplanwasnottoattack,
but lettheenemy make the firstmove every timeand
trytofindsomeway toprotect thecoast cities, that
whatweneeded wastime togetbetter equipped with
sufficient airplanes tocopewith theenemy's superior air
force. Soitwas finally decided thatthewisest course
topursue wasawaiting attitude.
There wasapanic inWall Street when thenewscame
ofthesurrender ofLosAngeles. Edna hadbeen left
incharge oftheoffice inNewYork andthruthesecret
Pocket Radio, kept incommunication withWaltetr and
Robert. Shewasconducting acampaign inthestock
market forthem andhadmade afortune ontheshort
side ofthemarket. Business wasbad,andthewhole
country wasinastate ofturmoil.
After thewhite flagswere floated over therains of
LosAngeles, dayswent byandthere were nomore

attacks bytheenemy, norwasanyword received from
enemy headquarters. TheAmerican patrol planes
around LosAngeles reported occasionally seeing the
enemy planes scouting over thecity atgreat heights,
evidently taking observation astowhatwasgoing on.
This mysterious action onthepart oftheenemy wasa
source ofworry tothecommanding officers oftheUnited
States. Thepeople alloverthecountry were inastate
ofanxiety, wondering where theenemy would strike
next. TheInfantry andCavalry were restlessly wait-
ingorders togointoaction along theRioGrande.
Onthenight ofAugust 1st,theenemy planes crossed
theRioGrande anddropped bombs allalong from
Brownsville toElPaso, destroying property andkilling
more thanahundred thousand menamong theInfantry
andCavalry. Theenemy planes were again flying very
high. The anti-craft guns and theattack byour
planes didvery little damage, onlybringing down ^\q
oftheenemy planes along theentire lines, while more
than200oftheAmerican airplanes were destroyed by
bombs dropping onthem from above. General Mar-

"Hell turned loose intheskylastnightfromBrownsville

United States toput intoimmediate use, butafter
meditating overthematter decided thattheywould only

General Pearson fororders topermit him togoona
scouting expedition overMexico andupanddown the

Onthemorning ofAugust 3rd,Captain Robert Gor-

thattheenemy hadanother discovery thatwould beat
what theAmericans had. Waiting forawhile, hesaw
whatseemed tobeanobservation platform emerge from

were either taking photographs ormaking observations
overElPaso forsome purpose. Fortunately, hehad

Before venturing tolandCaptain Gordon ascended to

moreenemy ships insight which might endanger his
life. Finding theairclear, heimmediately radioed
thenewswith hisPocket-Radio toCaptain Kennelworth
whowasthen stationed atSanDiego. Thenewswas
quickly flashed toGeneral Pearson's headquarters. On
examination theyfound thatthegiant shipwasamother
shipmore than 600 feet long, bearing thename of
^^Tokyo J-1''andthat itcarried 25bombing planes cf
themost modern type with collapsible wings and
equipped with powerful searchlights carrying bombs
andpoisonous gases. Itwasestimated thatmore than
100 officers andaviators were aboard theairship when
itfell. Allwere killed buttwo. They were badly

wounded withbroken limbs andwere taken prisoners.
There werefound tobethree oftheenemy's planes that
were notdamaged badly. Captain Gordon andCap-
tainKennelworth tested these planes after theywere
putback inworking order andfound thattheywere
high altitude planes andcould risehigher thananyof
theplanes usedbytheUnited States. Thiswasagreat
victory because itwould enable theAmerican inventors
tofindouthowthese planes were builtandthey could
alsobeused against theenemy.
iN'ews ofthisgreat victory wassent tothePresident
oftheUnited States. Heordered General Pearson to
decorate Captain Gordon with theCross ofAviation
andconvey tohimthegratitude ofthepeople ofthe
United States andthePresident's sincere personal ap-
preciation. Theafternoon newspapers inevery large
city intheUnited States carried inbigheadlines
"GIANT MOTHER SHIPCAPTURED BYDAR-
IJSFGYOUJ^G AVIATOR, CAPTAi:tT ROBERT
GORDO]^." The people thruout theUnited States
breathed asighofrelief; feltthatthetidewas atlast
turning andthatnowsomewaywould befound tode-
stroymore oftheenemy's giant ships.
When General Pearson called Captain Gordon before
him,hewasverymodest andmeek because heremem-
bered thesevere reprimand before when hedisobeyed
orders andbrought down theJapanes plane nearSan
Diego. This timehehadacted oninstnictions from
General Pearson andwasveryhappy tohave rendered
agreat service tohiscountry. AstheGeneral read the
message from thePresident, tearscame into hiseyes.

hoped hemight havemany more opportunities torender
service tohisbeloved country. Atthat time his
thoughts turned toMarie andhewondered where she
might beand ifsheknewwhatwashappening. Hewas
especially happy because hehadbrought thisenemy ship
down intheState inwhich hewasbornandthatState
ofwhich hewasvery proud. Captain Kennelworth
came tocongratulate himandsaid :^^Robert, oldpal,I

TheLone Star State ofTexas which wasdistinguished
byitsbrave sons attheBattle oftheAlamo, hasagain

Mexico aswell asSpain andJapan willbemade toreal-

After thenight attack andthegreat destruction along
theRioGrande, theAmerican forces waited anxiously
andinperil foranother attack. Days wentbywith-

from the"Tokyo J-1" sent totheMajor Electric Com-
pany intheEastwhere they could experiment with it
andmake some planes like itorbetter ones.Hegave
oneoftheplanes toCaptain Gordon andtheother to
Captain Kennelworth tobeputinto service. Captain
Gordon asked thattheybepermitted togointoMexico,

oftheir ships, buttheGeneral refused togrant this

CHAPTER XXYI
September, 1930
AFTER long days ofanxious waiting, with the
JTjl^ people nervous and excited, came tlieattack on
SanFrancisco. Theenemy planes attacked from the
West, theSouth andtheE'orth, slipping insilently
inlargenumhers. Poisoned gaswasturned loose,hombs
weredropped alloverthecityandmost oftheimportant
business andGovernment buildings were destroyed.
The destruction was thegreatest inhistory, much
greater than theearthquake in1906. Loss oflifewas
terrific. General Pearson ordered Captain Gordon and
Kennelworth tolead thedefense ofthecity,using the
Japanese planes which hadbeen taken from thewreck
ofthe"Tokyo J-1." Assoon asthey gotinhigh alti-
tude overSanFrancisco, theycould seethat thiswasa
gigantic attack. Thousands ofairplanes were circling
theairfrom every direction. Itwasevident thatthe
enemy intended todestroy SanFrancisco very quickly.
Captain Gordon andCaptain Kennelworth were able
tokeep incommunication thru their Pocket Radio.
They agreed thatoneofthem should attack theenemy
planes approaching from theISTorth andtheother, the
planes approaching from theSouth andWest, going as
high asthey could and ifpossible getting above the
enemy planes anddropping bombs onthem. When

Captain Gordon gothigh inthe air,hesawanother
mother shipanchored andwith thesmaller planes tak-
ingofffrom it.Hesailed overand letloose hisbomhs
anddestroyed thisship. Other shipswerecoming from
every direction bythethousands. Hesailed overthem
letting loose hisbombs cautiously.
Captain Kennelworth alsoencountered planes bythe
thousands coming across from theWest andsucceeded
inbringing downnumbers ofthem. Finally, theenemy
planes turned onhimandwhen hesaw that escape
seemed almost impossible, decided totrytoraceback
toheadquarters. Theenemy planes were firing onhim.
Onewing ofhisplane wasdamaged, then apropeller
wasbroken andashisplane wascrashing totheearth,
hefeltthathewassure tolosehislife ;tried tosteer
thebesthecould and finally, seeing thathewasgoing
tolandonasmooth spotwhere there werenotrees or
buildings, hecrawled outontopofoneofthewings.
Afewminutes after thecrash heregained conscious-
ness, finding himself uninjured with onlyafewminor
scratches. Fortunately hewasnear oneofthearmy
bases andmade hiswayquickly there. Hecould see
totheWest thatSanFrancisco wasinflames andknew
that thedestruction wascomplete. His firstthought
waswhathadhappened tohisoldpal,Robert Gordon.
Feeling inhispocket andfinding hisradio safe,hesent
thedistress signal which theyhadalways used, asking
"Areyoualiveandwhere areyou?"Minutes wentby
andnoreply.Hewasheartsick andfeared thatRobert
had losthis life.Heslowly made hisway tohead-
quarters andreported whathadhappened.


=== PAGE BREAK ===

292 THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
Captain Gordon finally exhausted hishombs, buthe
estimated thathehadbrought down several hundred
oftheenemy planes because hehad sailed overthem
where theywere flying bythehundreds inwedge for-
mations, each division being followed byagiant supply
shipwhich could anchor highupintheairandsupply
morebombs when thebombing planes exhausted their
supply andreturned formore. Robert thought, "this is
justwhat ourGovernment needs. Ifthere were only a
supply ship intheairnowwhere Icould goandget
more bombs, Icould bringdown hundreds more ofthe
enemy's planes." Hedecided tomake hiswayback to
thebase orheadquarters ashewaspowerless without
bombs, buthisdecision wastoolate.Theenemy planes
hadlocated himandwerecoming straight toward him.
Hespeeded upandtried tomake hisway tosafety,
fearing thatanyminute theenemy would fireonhimor
drop abomb onhisplane, buttheJapanese had dis-
covered thathewasflying oneoftheirownplanes and
theythought hewasoneoftheirown aviators andhad
nointention ofharming him.When they gotclose
enough toseethattheplane waspiloted byanAmerican
aviator, they flew close beside him, signaled him to
follow them, oneplane leading andtwoothers falling
inbeside him. There wasnothing elsetodoandhewas
glad ofachance tosave hislife.They ledhimup,up,
up,thousands offeetintheair,finally reached agiant
plane anchored, where they landed, taking Captain
Gordon aprisoner.
Assoon astheyhadlanded withhim, hismind went
back tothedays ofhisyouth, when hehad built his

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 194^0 293
firstbicycle torideonthewater, andwhen hehadread
theBible andtalked about thewars tocomeandmade
hisplans forthegreat airship. Herecalled thedream
hismother hadwhich greatly disturbed her. Shetold
himshedreamed thatshesawSanFrancisco destroyed
bysome terrible machine andthatoneofhersonshad
nearly losthislifethere. Hethought ofhowhismother
hadtoldhimabout hisoldest brother losing hislifein
theSanFrancisco earthquake andhewondered ifnow
hewas tolose hislifethere, because hefeltthat the
Japs were very treacherous andwould probably not
keephimaprisoner butwould take hislife.Heprayed
forhisdear oldmother andprayed forMarie thatshe
might besafeandher lifebespared, nomatter what
hisfatemight be.
Through allthis excitement, forthe firsttime he
thought ofhisPocket-Radio. Before hecould get it
outofhispocket, hereceived theS.O.S.signal from
Walter andanswered, telling himwhathadhappened
andwhere hewas.
Ever since thefirst battle ofLosAngeles, theUnited
States officers had felt certain thatanattack would
comeuponSanFrancisco andhadprepared for itthe
bestway possible. They hadconcentrated agreater
portion oftheir best airplanes there andhadthrown
them intothefightbythethousands andtheyhadgone
down inlarge numbers, notonlybeing outnumbered by
theenemy planes butbeing unable tofollow theenemy
planes highenough todestroy them. When reports
weremade thefollowing morning, more than three
thousand ofthis country's airplanes hadbeen lost.


=== PAGE BREAK ===

294 THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
The lossoflifeinSanFrancisco wasappalling. Almost
half ofthepopulation hadbeenwiped out. Most of
thevaluable buildings hadbeen destroyed. Allthe
ships anchored intheharbor wereblown topieces. A
poisonous gaswhich American chemists hadnever seen
orheard ofbefore hadbeen distributed alloverSan
Francisco andthepeople whowere leftwere sickand
dying bythethousands. Thewaters inthebayhad
beenpoisoned andthefishweredying from thisdeadly
gas. Itwasindeed atime oftrouble such astheworld
hasnever known, asspoken ofbySt.John intheBook
ofRevelation.
Thecapture ofCaptain Gordon andthelossofboth
oftheJapanese airplanes which hadbeen captured
atthedestruction ofthe"Tokyo J-1"wasadishearten-
ingblow, because Captain Kennelworth hadreported
how effectively hehadworked over theenemy planes
andhowmany hehad destroyed. Hewassure that
Captain Gordon haddestroyed many oftheir planes.
When asurvey wasmade ofthecity itwasfound that
several hundred oftheenemy's planes hadbeenbrought
down. Most ofthiswas attributed tothework done
byCaptain Gordon andKennelworth with thehigh
altitude foreign planes. When allreports were in,the
commanders oftheUnited States armies gottogether
foraconference. This disaster insuch ashort time
wasbewildering and itrequired quick decision asto
thenextmove. They were atalosstofigure outwhat
theenemy^s nextmove would be,remembering that
after LosAngeles hadbeen surrendered andthewhite
flaghad floated over it,ithadnever been molested.

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 295
Knowing thatanother attack would finish theremains
ofSan Francisco, they decided tosurrender it,and
again thewhite flagwasraised over alltheremaining
buildings. When General Pearson sawthese instruc-
tions being carried out,hewasovercome with emotion.
Tears were flowing down hischeeks andheexclaimed;
*^MyGod,myGod, istheland ofliberty tobedestroyed ?
Istherenoway toprevent thisdeadly destruction?''
Assoon astheJapanese hadcaptured Captain Gor-
dontheyknewwhohewas.Hewasthemanwhohad
soldthem thegreat silent muffler. They brought him
toheadquarters inMexico where hewasquestioned as
towhat other inventions hehad.Hetoldthem that
theonlyinvention hehadofvalue wasthesecret radio,
withwhich hecould sendcommunications without any
sound intheairandwithout anyone intercepting the
messages, butmade nomention oftheother discoveries
thathehadwhich heknew could beused intime of
emergency andofwhich hehadnever toldtheUnited

Robert hisfreedom andalarge amount ofmoney if
hewould sellthem thisinvention. After communicat-
ingsecretly andsilently wdth Walter, Robert hadhim
tellthecommanding General about theproposition the
Japanese hadoffered himandasked forinstructions as
towhat heshould do.Their replywas toremain pris-
onerandnotgiveupanyofhissecrets totheenemy,
because thesituation wasbadenough atthebest. But
Robert knew that hisservices would beofgreater value
tohisGovernment andthat itwasbadjudgment for

another invention forcommunications which would
outwit theJaps, sohedecided onhisownresponsibility
togiveupthesecret radio, andafter they tested it,they
gavehim hisfreedom andconveyed him safely outof
theenemy lines. Robert returned toheadquarters near
SanFrancisco andreported toColonel Davis justwhat
hehaddone.Hewasimmediately sentbefore General
Pearson whowasthen incommand oftheUnited States
Air forces. General Pearson after hearing thestory
andconsidering Robert's splendid record, decided that
clemency should beextended tohimbut,before doing so,
decided tocommunicate with thePresident ofthe
United States andawait hisdecision andinstructions.
Ameeting oftheCabinet wascalled andtheyvoted that
Captain Gordon wasatraitor tohiscountry, butdecided
thatheshould notbecourt-martialed and shot, but dis-
honored. Orders were sent that hisuniform betorn

thelossofMarie, buthehadfaith inGod.Heknew
thathehaddone right andwhatwasforthebest, just
astheCreator oftheuniverse does allthings welland

prison andwasconsoled byreading Job,where hesaid,
"Lord, Lord, I'llwait untilmychange comes." Robert
knew thatthetimewould comewhen hewould beable
todemonstrate tohisGovernment thathisjudgment was

could use,andtotellnothing ofthegreat ship*'Marie

intheAdirondack Mountains. Thatwhen theGovern-
mentcame torealize theneed ofgreat helpandfaced
defeat, hewould then demonstrate theinventions that
hehadtosavethecountry.
General Pearson wasverymuch interested inGor-
don's case.Heremembered thegreat featofbringing
down the^'Tokyo J-1"andbelieved thatRobert wasa
genius andavaluable man totheGovernment. Ifthe
officials hadlistened toRobert andtaken thediscovery
hehadoffered them, probably thedefeat inSanFran-
ciscowould never have happened. Hedidnotblame
Robert forselling hisinvention toJapan inpeace
time, nordidhecondemn him forturning over his
secret Pocket Radio totheJapanese tosecure hisfree-
dom. Believed hewasloyal tohiscountry andacted
ashethought bestandhadnotdone itforaselfish
motive. TheGeneral decided tovisit Robert atthe
prison. After holding aconference with him, ordered
himremoved andbrought toheadquarters where he
could keephimunder hispersonal supervision. Robert
confided toGeneral Pearson that ifhecould secure his
release, and lethimreturn tohislaboratory inISTew
York, hecould very quickly complete another inven-
tiontoenable theUnited States forces tocommunicate
secret orders from place toplace, which theenemy
could notunderstand oruse.Hetoldhimthathehad

aninvention partly completed which when placed acer-
taindistance from anairplane would prevent anycom-
munication byhissecret radio andthatwith this it
would make thesecret radio which heturned over to
Japan, absolutely useless. General Pearson believed
hisstory andhadfaith inhim socommunicated with
thePresident oftheUnited States andobtained per-
mission tosendRobert Gordon tohisISTewYork labora-
tory. TheGeneral realized thatthesituation wasmuch
worse than thenewspapers were letting thepublic know.
TheGovernment wassuppressing theirweakened con-
dition. General Pearson knew thatwith helpfrom
England oranyother foreign country, itwould beeasy
fortheenemy totakeNew Orleans, Chicago andthen
sweep down onWashington and IsTew York. The lib-
erty oftheUnited States nowhung inabalance and
unless something was done, anddone quickly, their
cause would belost.
General Pearson wrote tothePresident that there

andthattheenemy hadsomething uptheir sleeve and
thatunless every effortwasmade toforestall theirmove,

WHENRobert arrived in"New York, Edna told

ifhethought there wasanyhope oftheterrible war
ending soon. "No," hereplied, "itwill getworse in
1931whenmany other nations will join against us.
Theendwillnotcome until theSummer orFall of

Inthelatter part ofOctober, 1930, Robert returned
toDenver, Colorado, where General Pearson hadmoved
theaviation headquarters, andwasmoving heaven and
earth toprevent theadvance oftheenemy toward the
East.Many people onthecoasthadbecome frightened
andmoved toDenver forprotection. Robert brought
thenewinvention which hecalled the^'Radio Annuli-
fier." TheSpaniards andJapanese weremaking use
ofRobert's secret radio, which wasoneofthemost
valuable discoveries uptothat time. TheAnnulifier
wasnow placed onscouting airplanes andtheywere
Bent out.They found that itwould work adistance of
several hundred miles. This disorganized theenemy
forces because they didnotunderstand whathadgone
wrong with thesecret mechanism ofthePocket-Radio
withwhich theywere able totransmit orders without
sound orfear ofdetection. They had toresort tothe
oldmethod ofusing radios and wireless. Robert had
invented anewmachine torecord either sound orcom-
munications bylight waves. Hesoonsecured theplans
oftheenemy andreported toGeneral Pearson, whowas
stillincommand fortheAviation Corps, thattheenemy
wasplanning toattack from theGulf ofMexico, follow
uptheMississippi River, takeNew Orleans andatthe
same timemake ajoint attack across theGreat Lakes,
cutting offtheGovernment's forces andthewingwhich
:washolding across from Denver, Colorado toCanada on
theNorth andtheborder ofTexas ontheSouthwestern
side.When General Pearson received thisdisappoint-
ingnews, herealized thatthesituation wasdesperate.
Hecommunicated with thePresident oftheUnited

States, whoimmediately called theCabinet together.
AlltheArmy OflBcers were called inconference todis-
cuss plans astothebestthing todotoforestall the
attack. They were forced toadmit thepainful truth
that the fleet ofairplanes was not sufficient to
withdraw enough forces from theWestern line to
send totheISTorth andSouth, toprotect Chicago and
theMississippi valley. General Pearson made plain
totheWar Council thegreat value ofKobert Gor-
donand suggested that heberestored tohfs
former rank forwhat hehadalready done. They
agreed withhimandRobert Gordon wasmade Colonel
intheearly part ofN'ovember, 1930. Walter Kennel-
worth, forhisgreat services inworking with Robert,
wasalsopromoted toColonel.
When Colonel Gordon informed General Pearson that
Mrs.Kennelworth washissolesecret aidincompleting
theAnnulifier which hadhelped him togettheenemy's
plans, thisnewswasconveyed bytheGeneral tothe
President oftheUnited States whoordered Mrs.Ken-

totheplans ofprotection orattack.
Complications came thick and fast, theenemy was
landing more planes inMexico, bringing upreinforce-
ments. They moved part oftheir army from San
Francisco north, andinDecember, 1930, after ashort
engagement, captured Seattle andPortland. TheWar
Council knew that this lefttheenemy incommand of
theentire Pacific Coast asmost allofthesmaller towns
hadbeen abandoned because they feared destruction
andthenext attack would probably beeither onthe
South ortheEast. Theywere satisfied thattheywould
probably attack from theGulf ofMexico andtryto
getagood holdontheSoutheastern part oftheUnited
States and, ifsuccessful, would then attack fromCanada
andtheGreat Lakes. TheUnited States Government
wasmaking airplanes asfastaspossible, buttheywere
BOfarbehind andlacked trained men toman them,
thatthesituation wasvery tense andtheGovernment
officials freely expressed their anxiety. People inthe
Eastwere excited andscared. They feared anattack
upon thedefenseless cities atanytimeandthat the
destruction ofLosAngelss, San Francisco, Portland
andSeattle might berepeated. Thecrushing blows that
theGovernment hadreceived inthelossofthePacific
Coast hadweakened themorale ofthepeople andthey
had lostconfidence intheGovernment and itsofficials.
The fact that theenemy hadmade noattempt toset
afixedransom onanyofthecities captured showed that
theywere looking forsomething bigger before trying
toenforce theirdemands upon theUnited States. The

GoTemment officials knew that tlieJapanese would de-

bestaved offuntil theywere better prepared tomeet
theuL Army officials, asusual, thought theywere han-
dling everything forthebestandpaidnoattention to
thecounsel ofmenwhomight beable tohelp.
Colonel Kennelworth confided tosome oftheGen-
erals thatColonel Gordon andhimself hadsome great
discoveries which, when and ifcompleted would beat
theenemy, butthey paid little attention tohisstate-
ments, andafterWalter andRobert hadaconference,
theydecided tokeep quietandsaynothing further about
them until thetimewhen theGovernment wasindes-

1931
After months ofwaiting andonlyafewscouting ex-
peditions onthepart oftheenemy, asudden attack
occurred inMarch. Alarge fleet ofairplanes sailedup
theMississippi River andattacked New Orleans. De-
struction was swift and severe. TheUnited States
started towithdraw forces from across theCentral
partandfrom Texas, butthey soon realized that
somewhere out intheAtlantic Ocean orinthe
Gulf ofMexico, there was asecret base ofsupplies
andthey suspected thatEngland hadalready joined
forces with theenemy. Theenemy's planes were
sosuperior, their poisonous gasandbombs soeffective
thatNew Orleans fellwithin three days. Thealarm
spread sofastover theUnited States thatpeople were

panic-stricken. There wasapanic inWall Street.
Stocks crashed rapidly andCaptain Edna Kennelworth
wasagain ontheshort sideandhadmade alargeamount
ofmoney forthefirm ofGordon &Kennelworth.
After theterrible destruction ofISTew Orleans, itwas
again decided tofloat thewhite flagover the city, as
hadbeendone inLosAngeles, SanFrancisco, Portland
and Seattle. People were badly frightened ;were leav-
ingtheirhomes andproperty andgoing inevery direc-
tion, notknowing which wasthebestway togotosave
their lives. Many oftheolddarkies went tothe
swamps, hidoutuntil theywere starving todeath, feel-
ingthattheywere saferaway from anyofthe cities
orbuildings. Themost mystifying thing totheGov-
ernment officials was thatuptothistimewhen the
enemy hadsucceeded indestroying acity, theyhad
never returned orattempted todoanymore damage
after thewhite flagfloated over it.Theyknew thatthe
enemy hadseveral bases inMexico andwere ataloss
tounderstand whymore attacks hadnotbeenmade on
thetowns along theborder ofTexas ;butnowthatthey
hadstarted uptheMississippi River, itwasplain that
theywere bentondestroying only thelargest cities in
thecountry and that, eventually, theywould make de-
mands forlarge amounts ofindemnity and territory.
Whynodemands hadbeenmadeuptothistimeand
why theenemy hadnottried toland troops andtake
charge washard tounderstand. Thewiser headsamong
theGovernment officials feltthattheenemy wanted to
sufficiently frighten thepeople allovertheUnited States
anddestroy enough lifeandproperty thatwhen they

306 THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
didmake ademand, thatnomatter howunreasonable,
theUnited States would beforced toaccept. Itwas
thought thattherewassome secret treaty between Spain,
Japan, Mexico andother foreign countries, andthat
theyhadstarted theircampaign intheSouth andwould
later attack theEastern Coast because theyknew that
theywould gethelpfrom other countries ifitwas re-
quired.
After thefallof'New Orleans, theenemy continued
theirmarch uptheMississippi valley. Onebyone
important cities were bombed. ^Natchez, Vicksburg,
thenMemphis fellunder thefireoftheenemy. The
devastation was thegreatest everknown. ]^ot only
were thebuildings destroyed bybombs, but fireand
poisoned gases were used. Hundreds ofthousands of
people losttheir lives. People were soterrified that
theywanted tofleetothemountains and forests and
getawayfrom allthetowns. Themarch uptheMissis-
sippi thus farhad costtheGovernment the loss of
thousands oftheir bestairplanes. Theenemy^s losswas
very small. Onaccount offlying atsuch great heights,
itwashard toreach them with theanti-aircraft guns
orthearmy planes.
TheUnited States army officers knew thatthenext
objective would beSt.Louis, andthat ifSt.Louis were
captured, theywould probably attack Chicago, close the
lines, prepare toattack theEastern Coast andtryto
takeWashington andNew York. Colonel Gordon and
Colonel Kennelworth were doing great work, butwere
fighting against terrific odds. Theyhadtotake orders
from their superior officers, andwere notable toact

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 307
ontheirown initiative. Colonel Gordon waspermitted
tositinataconference oftbeWar Council inApril,
1931, butafter listening tohisplans, they refused to
accept them; atthesame time theyknew thecountry
needed helpbecause further attacks wereimminent, and
theenemy waspushing ontovictory andgaining more
help allthetime. Some ofColonel Gordon's plans were
toaskFrance tocome toouraidinview ofthefact
theyhadhelped usintheRevolution of1812andthat
wehadgone totheir rescue intheGreatWar in1917
showing ourappreciation fortheservices rendered by
Lafayette. Healsowanted toaskCanada tojoinus
andprotect theJ^orthern border oftheUnited States.
After the first battle ofINTew Orleans, theUnited
States transferred alltheplanes they could spare for
patrol oftheEastern andSouthern coasts along the
Atlantic andGulf ofMexico. Commercial and pas-
senger airplanes were crossing daily toandfrom
Europe. Onefoggy night inthemonth ofApril, scout-
ingplanes flying ashigh asthey could, sighted alarge
fleet ofairships flying toward Savannah, Georgia.
They decided thattheywereenemy planes making for
Savannah, toattack it.Commander Rooker incharge
ordered hiscompany tosailover the fleetand start
dropping bombs. They were quickly destroyed, all
falling intotheocean. When ourplanes descended to
seehowmany hadbeen destroyed andwhat country they
were from, theyfound thattheywere notenemy planes
atall,butwere commercial planes from England, Ger-
many, Austria and Italy. This complicated matters
more anddiplomatic communications failed tosmooth

out tlie difficulties. England refused toaccept anex-
planation orapology and alltheother countries took
sides with her.OurCabinet officers heldaconference.
They decided thatEngland andtheother countries,
knowing ourweakened condition, hadintended tojoin
theenemy allalong andwere only waiting foran
excuse, buttheynowknew thatwith allthese countries
against them, without some aidornew discovery, the
cause was lost. General Pearson said"Colonel Gordon
was right.Weshould have asked thehelp ofFrance
andCanada long before this.Wemustnowseek aid
fromanycountry that isfriendly tous.Wewent to
therescue oftheAllies inthedarkest days oftheWorld
Warandsurely some ofthem willstand byusinthis,
ourgreatest hour ofneed."
InMay, 1931, England, Germany, ItalyandAustria
joined forces against theUnited States. Thewealth of
theUnited States hadcaused somuch jealousy that it
nowbegan tolook asthoUncleSamwere alone eagle
against theworld. England began toland herforces
andestablish abase inCanada, andtheWar Council,
knowing thatEngland would attack theEastern Coast,
made allpreparations totrytoprotect theNorthern
border andtheEastern Coast, withdrawing forces from
other strategic points totrytoprotect theNorth and
theEastern part oftheUnited States.
Inthelatter part ofthemonth, England andthe
other allied enemy forces sailed across theAtlantic,
bringing their entire fleets onthewater escorted by
thousands ofmodem airplanes. Theyhadbeen prepar-
ingforwar foryears; had built fasthydroplanes


=== PAGE BREAK ===

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 809
which could travel onthewater atmore than 150
miles anhour. When this fleet arrived offtheAt-
lantic Coast, theUnited States airpatrol attacked
them, hutwere sofaroutnumbered that itwas
futile. The patrol was quickly destroyed. Allof
theUnited States commercial planes were stopped from
carrying mail, passengers orexpress across theAtlantic.
Theenemies werenowinposition toblockade theUnited
States onevery side. TheJapanese, Spanish andMexi-
canplanes were patrolling theGulf ofMexico andthe
Pacific Coast.Wewerenowinaworse position than
theAllies were in1917when theywere fighting with
their backs tothewallandtheUnited States went to
their rescue. TheWar Council knew thatEngland
would now close thel^orthem border, shutusofffrom
Canada andwould probably attack allalong theborder
sooner orlater.
TheUnited States hadconcentrated alltheavailable
forces which could possibly bespared totryand fore-
stall attacks upon Chicago andtheCentral part ofthe
country. While anattack washourly expected inSt.
Louis, part oftheEnglish, German andItalian battle-
ships, under theprotection oftheir airfleet,moved to
themouth oftheMississippi River. Theairplanes, num-
bering thousands, ledtheadvance uptheriver, followed
bythehydroplanes and battleships. The planes de-
stroyed cities anddrove thepeople away interror.
When thismarch started, theUnited StatesWarCoun-
cildecided tomove theInfantry andArtillery asfast
aspossible totryandprotect theterritory along the
Mississippi and prevent theadvance upthru the

310 THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
Central andIN'ortliem parts oftheUnited States. The
enemies tookcharge ofNew Orleans andplaced their
officers incontrol ofthecity. Fierce fighting continued
allthewayuptheriver. TheUnited States washope-
lessly outnumbered andthelossofmenandplanes was
enormous. Itbegan tolook asifresistance was folly.
Itwasplain that thiswasamove totakecharge ofour
territory andshowed thatJapan, Spain, andMexico
hadonlybeenwaiting forthetimewhen England and
other countries would jointhem tostart taking over
captured cities.
ThemoveuptheMississippi wasswift. Every town
wastaken overandplaced under thecontrol ofEnglish
officers. Finally, when Cairo, Illinois, wasreached the
United States hadperfected anewinvention fordrop-
ping chemicals from airplanes intothewater andthen
using anelectric current fromanairplane todischarge
thechemical hundreds ofmiles away.
When theenemy advanced andtheairplane attack
wasonatCairo, theinhabitants hadbeenmoved to
Louisville andCincinnati andtherewasnoattempt to
trytosave the city. Theplanwas tolettheenemy
hydroplanes and battleships move uptheriver and
destroy them bythepowerful electric charge inthe
water. When theyhadcompleted great destruction in
Cairo, thehydroplanes andlight battle cruisers which
followed uptheadvance, taking charge ofcities, moved
uptothemouth oftheOhio tolandandtake charge
ofCairo.
Colonel Walter Kennel worth hadbeen sent toCairo
with anewplane which hadbeen completed bythe(

Major Electric Co.This plane wasequipped withan
electric machine which could take theelectric current
from the air,charge intothewater, anddestroy battle-
ships formiles inevery direction. Hewascircling the
skyatahigh altitude andwatching foranopportunity.
Finally, seeing theairplanes receding from Cairowhen
they thought theyhadcompleted thedestruction, he
pressed abutton andturned loose thepowerful electric
ray. Inlessthan aminute every cruiser andhydro-
plane wasblown topieces orburnt upbytheelectric
current. Theenemy losteverymanonboard their
ships. While Cairo hadbeen almost completely de-
stroyed, thiswasthe first realvictory fortheUnited
States since Colonel Gordon destroyed the^^Tokyo J-1."
Thenews was flashed allover theUnited States and
people ontheEastern Coast, from Boston toMiami,
whofeared destruction atanyminute, breathed asigh
ofrelief andhoped that thiswould turn thetide. The
old-timers talked about theYankee ingenuity andsaid
thatthebrains oftheUnited States were thegreatest
intheworld andwould find away toovercome any
obstacle anddefeat theenemies nomatter howpower-
fulthey were.
After this disaster tothehydroplanes which had
beenmarching uptheMississippi, theenemy airfleet
ceased itsattacks forawhile, butabout theendofJune,
anairfleetswarmed over Cairo, landed without much
resistance, and officers were putincharge ofthetown.
TheUnited States hadalready asked France tocome
totheir rescue andimplored Canada toforbid England

ofgoodnewswhich cheered thecountry andputcour-
ageintothehearts ofthesoldiers whohadbeen fighting

CHAPTER XXYIII
OI:TJuly 4tli,1931, thepeople allover theUnited
States were celebrating thevictory atCairo where
theEnglish andGerman battleships andhydroplanes
hadbeen destroyed. Everything hadbeen quiet and
there hadbeennomore airattacks onthe cities.A
large fleet oftheenemies' planes were seen constantly
scouting upanddown theMississippi. Colonel Gor-
donhadsentoutascouting expedition withsome ofthe
planes equipped with powerful searchlights andthey
haddiscovered several mother supply ships, likethe
^^Tokyo," anchored atgreat heights above Cairo. He
knew that thismeant thatpreparations were beingmade
toattack St.Louis andcontinue theadvance upthe
Mississippi, that theenemy wasmaking forChicago
andtheGreat Lakes toform aline across theUnited
States sothattheir airplanes could control thisterritory,
shut offanyattacks from theWest while theyadvanced
ontheEastern and iN'orthern borders oftheUnited
States.
The !N'ation's birthday brought more good news.
Canada informed theUnited States thatshewould join
hands with her,order England's forces toleave Ca-
nadian territory andforbid them tocrossCanada to
attack theUnited States. Thisnewswasreceived in
Washington justbefore thePresident delivered hisan-

nual Independence address. While hisspeech was
short, hecalled attention tothefactthat thiswasthe
155th anniversary oftheindependence oftheUnited
States andthattheliberty ofthiscountry was threat-
ened greater than atanytime since thedays ofthe
Declaration ofIndependence, butstated thatcheering
news had justcomefrom Canada which would bea
great help ;thatFrance, ouroldfriend, whohadstood
byusbefore, hadalsocome toourrescue andthatthere
wasroom forhope. Therecent victory ofCairo wasof
great importance. Thenewinventions which were rap-
idly being completed would surely save theUnited
States inherhour ofgreatest need. Heurged the
people tobecourageous, notleave their cities ordesert
theirhomes unless absolutely necessary. While noone
could besureoftheend,hehoped thatadecisive victory
would begained within afewmonths.
Colonel Gordon reported what thescouting planes had
discovered andsaidthat thiscouldmean butonething,
that theenemy isconcentrating atCairo and that
thenext attacks would beonSt.Louis, then probably
Louisville, Cincinnati, andChicago. Ataconference
oftheWar Council, hesuggested thattherewasnouse
risking thelives ofthewomen andchildren inthese
cities ;thatarrangements should bemade tomove them
toplaces ofsafety atonce, thatcamps should beestab-
lished intheCatskills andAdirondack Mountains where
they could remain until thedanger hadpassed. The
Council, after discussing thematter, decided that this
would prove tobeabadmove onthepart oftheGov-
ernment because itwould disclose theirweakened condi-

tion totlieenemy whomight bescouting around St.
Louis athigh altitudes andwould seethepeople being
moved away andknow thatthecountry wasfrightened
andmake anattack immediately. TheCouncil decided
toprepare foranattack, believing thatwith thehelp
ofCanada andFrance, thiscountry would emerge a
victor.
Intheearly part ofAugust, 1931, theattack upon
St.Louis started. TheUnited States hadconcentrated
every available force there. Canada hadsenther air-
planes topatrol theI^orthern border, enabling the
United States towithdraw more forces toprotect the
Central part ofthecountry. The battle raged onand
off,dayand night. There were attacks andcounter-
attacks. TheUnited States factories were turning out
airplanes now attherateofmore than1000 perday.
TheHenry Motor Company ofDetroit hadmade great
improvements onbombing andscouting planes andwere
turning them outrapidly. Anewlong-range gunhad
been completed which would reach theenemy's planes
atgreater heights and thisproved tobeofgreat value
inthebattle ofSt.Louis. Onthethird dayofthe
battle, General Pearson ordered Colonel Gordon and
Colonel Kennelworth tolead theirmen against the
Southern andEastern wings oftheenemy. They suc-
ceeded inbringing down over500oftheenemy's planes,
andtheUnited States intheencounter only lostabout
200 planes. Thiswasvery encouraging andGeneral
Pearson ordered more ofthereserves thrown intothe
fightonthefollowing dayand thisseemed justwhat
theenemy waswaiting for.Onemistake after an-

otherwasmadebythesubordinate officers oftheUnited
States incarrying outinstructions forattacking. The
bombing planes ranshort ofammunition andwere de-
stroyed bytheenemies intrying toreturn totheir bases
forsupplies. Theenemy hadconcentrated more than
30,000 planes forthisgiant attack onSt.Louis. Build-
ingswere being destroyed daily andthelossoflifewas
great. Frightened women andchildren were rushing in
every direction only togetintothepath oftheexplod-
ingbombs. The enemy's planes proved superior,
larger andbetter-manned. Their large supply ships
anchored athigh altitudes enabled them togetintheir
effective work ofdestruction when theUnited States
planes ranoutofammunition.
After thebattle hadwaged for14days, with the
United States losing thousands ofplanes, thecause
seemed tobehopeless and St.Louis wassurrendered.
The situation wasgetting more desperate allthetime
andthepeople again were losing hope. Thelarge loss
ofairships atthebattle ofSt.Louis hadweakened the
U.S.Army regardless oftherapidity withwhich new
planes were being turned out.Theenemy tookcharge
ofSt.Louis andmoved partoftheir supply bases there.
The food situation was acute thruout thecountry.
Farmers hadbeen afraid togotothefield toplant any-
thing. Canada wasnotable tosupply allofourneeds
andwewere blockaded ontheSouth, EastandWest.
TheCabinet nowawoke tothefactthatmany mistakes
hadbeenmade andthatthesituation instead ofimprov-

time tobefully understood bythepeople allover the
United States, theEnglish andtheGermans attacked
theNorthern border, making forChicago. The lines
were tightly drawn, theenemy was stillholding the
Western Coast and itnowmeant onlyamatter ofcap-
turing Chicago, closeupthelinesbetween Chicago and
St.Louis, andcomplete theenemy's lines across the
Central part oftheUnited States. Council after coun-
cilwasheldwhile thefighting wasgoing onaround the
Great Lakes. TheGovernment rushed reinforcements
andthenewlong-range gunonourlarge cruising air-
shipswasable todoeffective work foralongtime in
protecting Chicago. England lost heavily inthe
battle around theGreat Lakes because Canada was
helping usthere, buttheblowwasheavy totheUnited
(States. Our losses inmenandplanes were tremendous.
Intheearly part ofSeptember, 1931, itwasplain
from theskirmishes which hadbeentaking place around
theGreat Lakes that theenemy wastrying toattack
Chicago and itwasonly aquestion oftimewhen they
would break thruandmake theattack. TheUnited
States officers were wellaware ofthefactthat ifChi-
cago fellintothehands oftheenemy, itwould place
theUnited States atagreater disadvantage than ever
todefend theEastern Coast. TheUnited StatesWar
Council decided tourgeFrance toattack England and
Germany andmake them withdraw forces from the
United States toprotect theirhome cities. France was
wellequipped with airplanes andcould rapidly destroy
thelarge cities inEngland andGermany andshewas
theonlycountry ontheother sidethatwecould look

France, thePresident ofFrance sentthefollowing mes-
sage toourGovernment:
"France ismindful oftheperilous position inwhich the
Land ofLiberty isnowplaced. Shehasnotforgotten thedays
when shecame toyour rescue during thestruggles ofthe
young republic, andyouproved thatyoudidnotforget when

About thistimeEngland andGermany knew that
France wasgetting ready toaidtheUnited States and
theyhadbeenpreparing toenlist theaidofother coun-
tries inorder tocomplete thevictories already wonand
gain control oftheUnited States anddivide upthe
territory. OnSeptember 6th,France made the first
attack uponLondon andthesame night attacked Berlin
from theair,destroying many buildings, with theresult
thatthere wasalarge lossoflife. Quickly following
this, England, Germany, Austria, Spain, Italy and
Japan called upon theother countries withwhom they
hadtreaties tojointhem inthefinal battles against the
United States, promising adivision ofthespoils. All

share inthegreat goldsupply thathadheen gathered
from allparts oftheworld bytheUnited States. Tur-
keyandRussia were the first tojointheenemy; then
quickly followed Rumania, Denmark^ Greece, Hungary,
Horocco andPortugal. These newsupporters tothe
enemy's cause rushed their airplane fleets totheEast-
ernshores oftheUnited States ;sentaidtoEngland and
Germany tohelphold offErance andkeep theenemy
from having towithdraw anyforces from theUnited
States toprotect theirown countries.
Theenemy, knowing thattheynowhad practically
allofEurope against theUnited States, were confident
that itwould onlybeamatter ofafewweeks totake
Chicago, Boston, 'NewYork andWashington, thenmake
theirownterms andtheUnited States would beforced
toaccept. TheUnited States knew thatthemost des-
perate battle ofthewarwasnowimpending andan-
other council washeld. They were expecting the first
blow tobestruck inChicago. Theenemy's reinforce-
ments hadarrived andwere scattered inevery direction.
Thenight ofOctober 1stproved tobeoneoftheworst
sofarofthewar. Theenemy attacked Omaha, Kan-
sasCity,Denver, Cincinnati, Louisville, Milwaukee and
St.Paul. The forces fromMexico attacked ElPaso,
SanAntonio, Galveston andHouston. Thegreater part
oftheUnited States forces being concentrated around
Chicago andtheEast, thisscattered attack alloverthe

cities because theywere notproperly prepared forthe
attack which came suddenly andunexpectedly.
Onthemorning ofOctober 2ndaCouncil washeld
and itwasdecided toimmediately send asmany air-
planes aspossible tohelp protect these cities because
anattack wasexpected again thatnight. Thiswas just
exactly what theenemy wanted,—^togettheUnited
States toscatter forces, withdrawing partoftheir armies
which were protecting Chicago.
Onthenight ofOctober 2ndtheenemy concen-
trated anattack ofmore than 50,000 planes against
Chicago andbroke thrutheUnited States linesonevery
side. England, Germany andRussia turned loose their
giant dreadnought battle planes, thelargest thathad
everyetbeenused intheWar intheAir.Many ofthese
planes carried 12-to36-inch guns. They wereequipped
with thelatest improved 12-cylinder motors ;were oper-
atedbyelectricity aswell asgasoline. These giant
planes could besupplied withpower thru theairby
radio current. Theattack waswell-timed andtheyhad
every advantage oftheUnited States forces. The first
attack destroyed Chicago's great skyscrapers. The
Board ofTrade Building, Post Office andother Gov-
ernment buildings were completely destroyed. Loss of
lifewas appalling. Over amillion people lost their
lives. More defenseless women andchildren were killed
than inanyother battle during thewar.
When thesunroseover thegreaty City ofChicago
onthemorning ofOctober 3rd,buildings were smoulder-
inginruins inevery direction. Itwasthegreatest
destruction thathadeverbeen inthehistory ofthe

world. 'Nomortal tongue could describe theterrifying
sights. There wasabrief respite. Asthesunrosethe
enemy's planes which hadwreaked their vengeance,
withdrew. TheUnited States had lostmore than25,000
planes andtheir best aviators hadgonedown inthis
terrible disaster.
Colonel Gordon andColonel Kennelworth haddone
wonderful work andfortunately their liveshadbeen
preserved forfuture usetotheir country. AsColonel
Gordon made hisway toheadquarters toreport to
General Pearson, hethought ofwhat hehadread in
theActs 2:17: "And itshallcome topass inthelast
days, saith God, Iwillpour outofmySpirit upon all

andyouryoungmen shall seevisions, andyour oldmen

dreamed andprophesied andhowhehadbelieved the
Bible knowing thatthese terrible things would come in
thelatter days. Ashesawtheblood, the fire,thesmoke
andtheruined city, foramoment hewondered why
Godshould permit such destruction asthisinorder that
theScriptures might befulfilled, butthenhethought

322 THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
TheUnited States officers knewnow that ifthey
held out,Chicago would becompletely annihilated be-
cause England's giant bombing planes were able tode-
stroy every building and killevery living soul. General
Pearson called allthecommanding officers together and
they quickly agreed thatwith theenemy outnumber-
ingthem 50to1,another attack would besoon over
withandthat itwasauseless sacrifice ofhuman life
and their remaining planes tooffer resistance. But
before surrendering, they decided toasktheconsent of
thePresident andhisCabinet. ThePresident hastily
called theCabinet together andwhen they assembled,
their faces were grave. They allknew whathadhap-
pened thenight before inChicago. ThePresident with
sadness inhisvoice read thedecision ofthecommand-
ingGenerals andsaid :^^This isthegravest crisis this
country hasever faced. Tosurrender maymean the
lossofourcountry andourliberty ;togoonand fight
maymean even worse. Tosurrender Chicago andwait
fortime todetermine thenextmovemaybethewisest
plan.Wecanonly trust toGodandhope. What is
your decision, gentlemen V^"Notaman rose todiscuss
thematter. Onebyonetheyanswered :"Itseems best
topermit ourcommanding officers tosurrender Chi-
cago."
ISTews wasquickly flashed toheadquarters atChicago
andabout 10a.m. thewhite flagwashoisted from the
fewremaining tallbuildings andalarge plane wassent
outtocircle theskywithwhite flags floating from its
wings. Assoon asChicago wassurrendered, theenemy
planes andland forces were brought upand they

closed tliegapbetween Chicago and St.Louis, leaving
theCentral lines intact andtheWestern lines holding
thePacific Coast.
Thel^ewYork Stock Exchange closed toprevent
complete panic because thepeople were panic-stricken
and selling stocks regardless ofprice. They soon dis-
covered that theenemy had bases forsupplies and
ships allupanddown theAtlantic andintheGulf of
Mexico. They were incontrol ofthe^N^orthern border
andinposition toattack theEastern Coast from the
]^orth, South, EastandWest. There wasnominimizing
theseriousness ofthesituation. The fallofChicago
hadbroken theheart oftheAmerican people. They
were panic-stricken and itlooked asthoforthe first
time inhistory, OldGlory would trail thedust. There
wasagreatWar Council held. Tomake aplea for
peace atthistimemeant surrender totheenemy and
accepting anyterms thattheymight want todictate.
The leaders oftheWar Council were puzzled. They
didn't know whatmove tomake next since theywere
overwhelmed bygreat odds. TheUnited States was
practically alone inthefight. France andCanada were
theonly countries which hadnotjoined forces against
theUnited States. When thenews ofthefallofChi-
cago reached France, they realized thatAmerica was
doomed.
TheUnited States Government officials knowing the
seriousness ofthesituation made noattempt toconceal
it,butdecided toplay fortime. They replied tothe
notefrom theenemy andasked foranarmistice to
lastthirty days, inwhich neither sidewould make any

toarrive atanyacceptable terms. Theenemy taking
this asanadmission ofdefeat andweakness onthepart
oftheUnited States granted 15days' time foradis-
cussion ofterms, andsentthefollowing note:
The Allied Powers demand thecomplete surrender ofthe
United States andadivision ofterritory; Japan tohave the
Western coast, England tohave theEastern coastandNorth-
ernterritory bordering onCanada; Mexico tohave Texas,
andSpain tohave theterritory along theMississippi andGulf
ofMexico. TheUnited States istoturn over totheAllied
Powers itsentire goldsupply andthepeople tosubmit tothe
various Governments towhich theterritory isallotted and
there istobenolonger anj^United States ofAmerica. If
theGovernment oftheUnited States refuses toaccept these
terms, wewilldestroy Boston, New York, Philadelphia and
Washington, andtake charge oftheEastern coast ofthe
United States. Your answer must bereceived within the

W'H.'ENthese terms were received, everyone was
gloomy atheadquarters. ThePresident called
hisCabinet foraconference. AUnited War Council
was also called, andafter along discussion, theywere
forced toadmit that itwasnotonlyaprobability but
apossibility that theenemy would take IN^ewYork
City, capture theEastern ports, andWashington, and
then dictate anyterms theymight desire. Tosubmit
totheterms already offered would mean ruinand dis-
grace butthequestion waswhat todo.Menhighup
andGovernment officials whohad relied upon their
judgment before, now realized thatonemistake after
theother hadplaced thecountry inthis terrible posi-
tion. Colonel Charles Manson, adescendant ofthe
family ofGeneral Lee, aroseandasked theWarCoun-
cilifhemight have permission tospeak. Itwas
promptly granted because hewas aman highly re-
spected forhisgood judgment, andonewhohadhad
advocated thebuilding ofgreater air fleets and pre-
paredness years before thewar started. Hisspeech
wasasfollows:
General Pearson andSons ofLiberty: This country
now faces thegravest situation since thedays ofWashington
andthewinter atValley Forge. Wearenotonlymenaced
byEngland, our oldenemy, butpractically bythewhole
world. France now isouronly friend. Theenemy isin

control andcanattack from every side. Itisatime tothink,
andthink seriously; atime foraction rather than words.
Weneed themanofthehour, andintimes past, theUnited
States hasalways produced thatman. Iamagreat believer
intheBible. Ihave read thepredictions made byColonel
Robert Gordon ever since hewasaveryyoung man. Just
what ishappening nowhepredicted years ago.Hehasmade
some remarkable inventions. Wasbornunder thesignwhich
astrologers calltheAscendant Sign oftheUnited States, the
sign Gemini, ruled byMercury, theMessenger oftheGods.
This sign issymbolized bytheancients asthedouble-bodied
sign. Itisasignofgenius and intellect. Ancient mythology
tells usthatoneofthetwins wasagreat warrior, and his
brother agreat inventor andthatheinvented allofthewar
instruments which helped hisbrother towin hisvictories. He
wassaid tobesoswift andshrewd thathehadwings onhis
heels andwings onhisshoulders. Could sipthewinefrom
thecupsoftheGods while theywere drinking, without getting
caught.
This sign hasalways symbolized theUnited States and
Yankee ingenuity. The greatest inventions thathave ever
beenweremadebyUnited States inventors. Theairplane was
invented here, thesubmarine, thegreat guns which have been
used inwar, thesteamboats, electricity, radio, andother valu-
ableinventions toonumerous tomention. From what Iknow
andhave read, Istillhopeandbelieve that theUnited States
hasthebrains tooutwit theentire world. Ibelieve thisbe-
cause itistheland ofliberty, because there never hasbeen a
nation toconquer it.TheUnited States hasnever beenan
aggressor, never entered awaronitsown accord. Ibelieve
thatGod iswithusandthat this isthecountry established
forGod's kingdom.
Ihaveread theBible andfollowed Colonel Gordon's writings
and believe with St.Luke, Chap. 7:22,"Then Jesus an-
swered andsaiduntothem *Goyourwayand tellJohnwhat
things yehave seenandheard, how that theblind see,the

more thanaprophet, forIsayunto you,Among those thatare
bom ofwoman, there isnotagreater prophet thanJohn the
Baptist, buthethat isleast inthekingdom ofGod isgreater
than he.'"
Isaytoyou,gentlemen, thatIbelieve there isnotagreater
prophet than Colonel Gordon. Further, Ibelieve thatheis
thegreatest inventor thattheUnited States haseverproduced,
andbelieve thathecansave thesituation orfindsome solution
oftheproblem. TheArmy Of&cers made amistake notto
listen toColonel Gordon when heoffered them advice and
toldthem hecould complete aninvention tosave thecountry.
Ibelieve theprophecy ofDaniel which hasoften been re-
ferred tobyColonel Gordon, Chap. 7:27,"And king-
domanddominion, andthegreatness ofkingdom under the
whole heaven, shallbegiven tothepeople ofthesaints ofthe
Most High, whose kingdom isaneverlasting kingdom, and all
dominions shall serve andobey him." Ibelieve that refers to
theUnited States. Ifwecanwin thiswar, then asweare
oneagainst theworld, itshall beakingdom oftheUnited
World. Inmyjudgment itwould bewise toplace Colonel
Robert Gordon insupreme command andfollow hisinstruc-
tions totheletter.
After Colonel Manson hadceased talking and sat
down, complete silence reigned forseveral minutes. The
WarCouncil knew thattherewere onlythreemore days
leftuntil thetime ofthearmistice wasupwhen the
enemy would attack. General Pearson wasthe first

General Pearson washeld ingreat respect bythe
Army officers, andhisjudgment wasnotquestioned. A

General Pearson aroseandsaid, ^^Colonel Gordon, by

saidsimply, "Ithank youforthehonor andconfidence,
butbefore completely accepting Iwant toaskifImay
have theunanimous consent oftheentireWar Council

When hehadfinished speaking, therewasnotawhis-

When Supreme Commander Gordon hadfinished his

Supreme Commander Gordon replied :"The trouble
inthepasthasbeen thattheenemy used noiseless air-
planes. Ournextgreat handicap wasthefactthatthey
could rise toheights towhich weareunable toattain,
giving them theadvantage inthefighting. Ofcourse,
wehave been hopelessly outnumbered from the start,
bythatImean, intheamount ofequipment. Another
thing thatweneedandmust have, which theenemy
already has, isanairship thatcanbeanchored and re-
main anchored intheairforanindefinite length oftime.
Weneed aship thatcantake itspower from the air,
giving itanunlimited cruising radius. Weneed other
ships forcruising purposes andscouters thatcantake
theirpower from the air,nothaving toreturn tothe
base atanytime forfuelorammunition, working from
abase intheairatalltimes. Thenextandmost im-
portant thingweneed isaninvisible plane. Anin-
visible, noiseless plane willbeoneofthethings tobeat
theenemy. When ourplanes cantravel high orlow,no
longer beseen orheard, wewillbeable toobtain in-
formation about theenemy's position andplans and
thereby know theirweak points, when andwhere to
attack.
"The great mistake thatthearmy officers havemade
from time totimewasinnotlistening tothecounsel of
younger men.By this, Idonotmean myself alone.
Myauthority forthis istaken from theBible,—Prov.
20:18: ^Every purpose isestablished bycounsel, and
with good advice make war.' Prov. 24:6: ^For the

"My strength andpower isintheLord andIshall

wasofGodandthey dwelt intheir steads until the

thewillofGodandtofulfill theScriptures andtowork-

you toSt.Luke 1:37: TorwithGodnothing shall

"Read Acts 17:26:'And hathmade ofoneblood

earth ;andhathdetermined thetimes before appointed,
and thebounds oftheir habitation.' Allmen are
brothers and itisGod's willthattheyshould dwell to-

divine powder ofAlmighty God. Intime ofwar,man
hasdugtunnels under theearth inorder thathecould

WHENthecommanders oftheAllied Enemy in

made some wonderful invention which hadmade him
confident ofwinning thewar. TheJapanese Generals,
knowing what thismight mean andfearing thegreat
genius, Robert Gordon, asked foranallied warcouncil
toconvene before making another attack. OnOctober
21st itwasdecided thattheWarCouncil should beheld
intheCity ofMexico. The allied enemy were con-
fident thattheUnited States would notmake anyattack
inthenear future, butwould wait forthem tomake
thenextmove. They feltthatthegreat losses which
hadbeen suffered bytheUnited StatesArmy atthe
battle ofChicago placed them innoposition tomake
animmediate attack and that they would try to
strengthen their position forthenext attack bythe al-

generals ofalltheallied enemy nations should proceed
atonce totheCity ofMexico tohold acouncil and
decide what thewisest andnextmove should be.They
leftinthedead hours ofthenight inthefastest planes

destroy thefactories ofthebigautomobile concerns and

When Colonel ISTagato had finished speaking, the
Spanish, English, German, Austrian andRussian Gen-

numerous disagreements before itwas finally agreed
astojustwhat thenextmove should be.Finally they

United States.
Thedelay bytheAllied Enemy wasjustwhat Su-
preme Commander Gordon wanted. Itgavehimtime
toprepare. Hehadordered theHenry Motor Com-
pany ofDetroit toproceed atonce tomanufacture ac-
cording tohisplans which hesentthem, twolarge
machines, onepositive andonenegative, bywhich he
could send currents ofelectricity thru theairandpro-
duce avacuum, orashecalled it,a"Tunnel thru the
Air." These plans hadbeenworked outyears before
andtherewasnoquestion butwhat themachines would
work successfully. TheHenry Motor Company had
beencommandeered bytheUnited States Government
andassoon astheyreceived theorder andplansfrom the
Supreme Commander, they started running dayand
night working tobuild thetwogiant machines.
The fifteen days' armistice expired onOctober 18th,
1931. Supreme Commander Gordon wasinreadiness
andwaited the first attack oftheenemy. Less than
thirty daysfrom thetime thatheordered work started
onthemachines, they reported thatthemachines were
completed andready totest out.Hecalled Colonel
Kennelworth tohisoffice inISTewYork andexplained
tohimthatthegreatVacuum Producer, asthemachine
hadbeennamed, hadbeen completed; ordered him to
proceed atonce toDetroit and testoutthemachines
both forshort andlong distance work.
Colonel Kennelworth arrived inDetroit onITovem-
ber17th. Thefollowing daytested outtheTunnel ma-
chines; reported toSupreme Commander Gordon that

theywereworking infineshape andproducing results
according totheplans. TheSupreme Commander then
decided togoimmediately toDetroit andestablish one
ofthemachines atabase there andhave Colonel Ken-
nelworth take theother machine toCincinnati and set
itup.Themachine wastransported secretly and suc-
cessfully toCincinnati and setupinoneofthelargest
buildings inthecity.
OnE'ovember 20th, Supreme Commander Gordon
andColonel Kennelworth tested theTunnel machines
over thislong distance. Themachines were settopro-
dueatunnel 100yards wide atfirstandwere setin
motion. TheAmerican scouting airplanes were sent
offoveradescribed areaandonentering between these
linesfound thattheywere inacomplete tunnel. They
could travel quickly backandforth thru theTunnel
intheAir. Thiswasagreat triumph. Commander
Gordon instructed allthose connected with thetestto
keep itacomplete secret. Heknew that thiswasgoing
tobeagreat surprise totheenemy when they started
their next attack.
Supreme Commander Gordon hadnow completed
another new invention onthesame plan oftheradio
thathehad touseinhis office in'NewYork several
years before torecord conversations when themanipu-
lators were trying tocatchhiminthestock market. He
hadenlarged thismachine sothat itwould record voices
3000 milesawayandnamed itthe"Tel-Talk.''
Onthenight ofNovember 19th, 1931, theSupreme
WarCouncil which hadconvened inMexico Citybroke
upandthecommanding generals returned totheir vari-

ousposts around St.I^uis andChicago. Supreme
Commander Gordon hadhispowerful Tel-Talk directed

between Chicago, St.Louis and'New Orleans. When
hewent tohisheadquarters inDetroit onthemorning
of^November 20th, hewent intolook athisTel-Talk,
sawthattherehadbeen aconference oftheenemy held
thenight before. Hepushed theneedle ofthemachine
backandturned iton;puthiseartothereceiver and
listened. Hefound thatthecommanding generals had
talked over theconference inMexico andhadnow de-
cided that their next attack would beonDetroit in
order todestroy thefactories there andprevent the
United States continuing making airplanes andinven-
tionswhich might helpthem towinthewar.Hewas
veryhappy togettheplans oftheenemy. Itwasjust
what hewanted. Hewasanxious totesttheTunnel

anddestroy them. Hewasimpatient andanxious for
andattack upon Detroit anddecided todefy theenemy
andurgethem on.
With theplans oftheenemy inhispossession, Su-
preme Commander Gordon decided tochange theloca-
tion oftheTunnel machines soastoprotect thefac-
tories andlarge buildings inDetroit. Hearranged the
machines sothatwhen theattacking planes came over
Detroit atahigh altitude, hecould dropthem intothe

Tunnel thru theAirandthusprevent anyharm tothe
factories orbuildings inDetroit. Hewaited patiently
foranattack upon thecity, butnomove ofanykind
wasmade bytheenemy. When itwasnearThanks-
giving, hehadagreat desire that thebattle should
startaround thattime sothattheUnited States might
have thegreatest Thanksgiving inhistory because he
wasconfident that iftheattack came, Detroit would bo
successfully defended andtheenemy forthe firsttime
would findthatwehadoutwitted them.Hedecided to
urge theenemy tomake anattack onDetroit assoon
aspossible, soordered alarge electric sign built with
letters twenty feet high,^'DETROIT ISREADY-
WONT YOUCOMEANDTAKE USWEWANT
TOBEYOURTHANKSGIVING TURKEY.'' The
signwasplaced onanairplane andlighted. Thisplane
passed infullview oftheenemy's lines atSt.Louis
andChicago. What theenemy thought ofthis,perhaps
noonewilleverknow. Colonel Manson laterwrote that
this electric signputthefear ofGod intheheart of
theenemy; thattheGermans recalled thedayswhen
theYankees arrived atthetime ofthegreat World
War. The Japanese, theSpanish andtheEnglish
realized that thiswasnotmeant forabluffandthought
theyhadmade amistake inallowing 15days' armistice,
now thattheUnited States haddecided tofight again.
How they could hope towin, theenemy could notsee.
They decided toteach thisyoung, boastful commander
alesson thathewould never forget.
OnThanksgiving night, November 24th, theattack
wasordered. Supreme Commander Gordon was atdin-

nerandamessenger interrupted him totellhim that
*^Tel-Talk'' hadpicked upanimportant message. He
rushed tothesecret roomandnoticed thataconference
hadbeen heldandorders given bytheenemy toattack
Detroit thatnight. Heimmediately communicated this
information secretly with thenew Pocket-Radio to
Colonel Kennelworth inCincinnati. Toldhim tobein
readiness toadjust theTunnel machine andchange the
location and altitude anymoment thatheinstructed.
Heordered allthelights inthestreets ofDetroit tobe
keptonthat night. Ithasbeen thecustom formany
months, since longbefore theattack atChicago, tokeep
allthecities indarkness atnight.
Hehadjustcompleted another newinvention which he
called theRadium Ray. With thisRayhecould locate
anything inthesky75to100miles away. Hehadthe
Radium Raymachine inreadiness tosearch theskyfor
the first attack that night. Just before 10o'clock he
wassweeping theskywith theRadium Raywhen he
discovered theenemy planes approaching from thedirec-
tionofChicago. There wasalarge flock ofthem flying
atveryhigh altitudes, followed bythree large supply
ships. Heknew thatthese supply shipswould anchor
intheairsomewhere over Detroit andthebombing
planes would make theattack. Hedecided tosendCap-
tainMorrison, thefamous aviator whohaddistinguished
himself atthebattle ofChicago, toleadafleetofdecoy
airplanes tomeet theinvading planes andtoleadthem
intotheTunnel thru theAir. Captain Morrison led
hisswift cruisers intotheairtothegreatest heights

enemy theybegan toturn loose therapid-firing anti-
aircraft guns. Assoon astheenemy discovered the
firing, they turned their searchlights onourplanes,
located and started after them. Captain Morrison
obeyed orders and retreated rapidly with theother
planes following. Hemade straight forDetroit tothe
vicinity ofmain buildings andfactory districts with
theenemy planes inhotpursuit. Suddenly hereceived
aradio message fromSupreme Commander Gordon to
descend verylowand flyl^orthwest. Atthistime the
Supreme Commander wasincommunication with Col-
onelKennelworth andtheyhadadjusted theTunnel
machines andestablished theTunnel thru theAir.
Supreme Commander Gordon wasatoponeofDe-
troit's giant skyscrapers over80stories highwatching
theaction oftheenemy planes. Suddenly hesawthe
first battalion ofmore than 250 planes, which were
flying inawedge formation, dive intotheTunnel. He
followed them with theRadium Rayandsawimmedi-
ately thattheTunnel wasdoing itswork andthat the
giant battle planes werenowpowerless, l^extcame the
three giant supply ships. Following thesame course as
thebombing planes, theydived intotheTunnel thru the
Airandwere powerless toproceed further. Once the
planes were intheTunnel, theywere unable tocom-
municate with headquarters ormake anymove because
theTunnel wasacomplete vacuum andnoplane could
move initexcept theAmerican planes which understood
thecombination how tonavigate thru theTunnel. As
soon asSupreme Commander Gordon sawthatthegreat
Tunnel machines were doing their miraculous work, he

sentanother defiant message totlieenemy headquarters
inChicago and St.Louis:
Wehave given your firstbattalion awonderful Thanksgiv-

aviators tohaveThanksgiving supper with us.
Immediately after thismessage wasreceived, thecom-
manding generals ordered amessage sent tothesupply
ships which were supposed tobeanchored over Detroit,
asking information astowhatwashappening. Nore-
plywas received. This caused consternation inthe
enemy camp. Theyknew thatthe first battalion had
either beencaptured ordestroyed. Thenewswasquickly
flashed toheadquarters intheCity ofMexico andGen-

These planes sooncame inview oftheKadium Eay.

lower until suddenly theyplunged intotheTunnel thru

There wasnotmuch tobethankful forinthecamp

from them, made itplain thattheUnited States was
notbluffing andthatSupreme Commander Gordon knew

outontheenemy planes, andthat ithadbeen success-
ful. Itwasnowatime tomove cautiously. Thenext
andfuture moves must bemade inaway toconserve
their resources andassure final success.
Everything wasquietandnomove orattack wasmade
until December 7th,when theenemy held acouncil
anddecided thatagigantic attack onDetroit should be
made ;thattheyshould concentrate alarge partoftheir
forces there; destroy thefactories andtake Detroit;
thenproceed toattack !N"ewYorkandtheEastern Coast.
Theplanwastomake adaylight attack and, ifpossible,
tosurprise Supreme Commander Gordon. About 3
o'clock intheafternoon theenemy planes were seen ap-
proaching from theEastandWest. Hesawthat this
wastobeagigantic attack because therewasalarger
number ofplanes thantheyhadused atanytime since
theattack ofChicago. Before hecould gettheTunnel
machines inworking order andestablish awider range
intheTunnel thrutheAir,theenemy planes hadbegun
dropping bombs ontheoutskirts ofthecityandhad
destroyed many ofthesmaller buildings. TheUnited
States planes were attacked andbeing unable torise
totheheights atwhich theenemy planes were flying,
agreatmany ofourplanes went down, butinafew
minutes theTunnel thru theAirwasinworking order
andtheenemy planes began tobedrawn into it.Within
lessthananhourmore than2500 planes hadbeen cap-
tured. The lossoflifearound thecityhadbeen small

because thebombs wbicb hadbeen dropped hadnot
reached thethickly populated sections ofthecityandno
plane hadbeen able toreach thefactories orbusiness
sections where thelarge buildings were.TheTunnel thru
theAirwasprotecting andkeeping themaway from
these sections. Canadian planes hadcome totheassist-
ance oftheUnited States ontheISTorthern border and
were patrolling theother sideoftheriverandpreventing
theenemy from attacking from the ISTorth.
About 5o'clock, thegigantic concentrated attack took
place. Itwasestimated that there weremore than
25,000 planes oftheenemy inthis attack. They were
supported byabout 10supply ships which sailed ata
great distance andwere attempting toanchor. Supreme
Commander Gordon knew that itwasnecessary tosacri-
ficesome oftheAmerican planes inorder todraw this
attacking force intotheTunnel thru theAir.Hesent
more than1000 ofourbestplanes tomeet theattack
andleadtheenemy intheright direction. Theenemy
turned loose their large 12-inch gunsandtheydestroyed
ourships rapidly. Planes were falling allover Detroit.
Thepeople wereverymuch frightened andthought that
thiswasgoing tobeanother disaster such ashad oc-
curred inChicago. Finally Captain Morrison changed
plans andledtheenemy toward theTunnel thru the
Air. Soonmore than 10,000 oftheir planes hadgone
intotheTunnel never toreturn again. T\Tien thislarge

been captured.
When allreports were in,Supreme Commander Gor-
donfound that theUnited States had lostabout 400
oftheir bestplanes, buthadcaptured more than 12,000
oftheenemy planes. Hewasvery greatly elated over
this victory because heknew thatwhen theenemy
planes retreated, itwasthe firsttime theyhadever
returned totheir basewithout areport ofvictory. He
feltthat thiswould break themorale oftheenemy;
makethemmore cautious inthefuture;givehimmore
timenow tocomplete hisinvisible airplane andtheone
which would risetoanyaltitude. When thiswascom-
pleted together with other machines forestablishing
Tunnels thru theAir, thebalance would beeasyand
amere question oftime until theenemy could allbe
destroyed orputtosleep. People thruout theUnited
States were stillinapanicky, restless state. Ever since
theattacks atLosAngeles, San Francisco, Chicago,
Kansas City, IsTew Orleans andtheSouthern part of
Texas, every large andsmalltown alloverthecountry
hadremained inastate offear, expecting anattack at
anymoment. LIundreds ofthousands ofpeople had
moved from thePacific Coast andfrom theCentral and
Eastern parts oftheUnited States intothemountains
oftheWest andtheGrand Canyon. They feltthat
there werenolarge cities andnothing toattack around
theGrand Canyon andthat itwasthesafest place to
go.Thousands ofpeople were living intentsandthere
wasagreat scarcity offoodandmuch suffering.
Supreme Commander Gordon decided thatthepeople

352 THETUNNEL THRUTHEAIR
should begiven someencouragement andthatthenews
ofthefailure ofthesecond attack upon Detroit should be
given tothenewspapers; thought itwould encourage
andcheer thepeople. Onthemorning ofDecember 8th,
allthenewspapers thruout theUnited States, carried big
headlines: "DETROIT ATTACKED THESECOND
TIMEBYTHEENEMY EORCES BUT DE-
FEATED. THOUSANDS OFTHEIR PLANES
HAVEBEEN CAPTURED. THERE HASBEEN
PRACTICALLY NOLOSSOFLIFEANDNO
IMPORTANT BUILDINGS DESTROYED.'^ The
papers emphasized thefactthat thismeant theturn of
thewarandthattheplacing ofSupreme Commander
Gordon atthehead ofourforces hadsaved thecountry
andthattherewasnolonger need foranygreat alarm.
Itwasaquestion ofonly afewmonths tillthewar
would beoverandtheenemy would bedriven from
our soil.
Thedefeat atthesecond attack ofDetroit hadindeed
putthefear ofGod inthehearts oftheEnemy, but
theyhadnotbyanymeans losthope. They were get-
ting recruits rapidly from Europe. Every nation was
building airplanes asfast asthefactories could turn
them outandsending them totheUnited States toaid
their allies. Practically every nation ontheface of
theearth, outside ofFrance, Canada andafewcoun-
tries inSouth America and Australia, had joined
against theUnited States. Thisencouraged theEnemy
andthey feltthatnomatter what theUnited States
had, intheendtheywould notbeable towin. The
great problem nowwastofindoutwhat theAmericans

were using inorder tocapture theenemy planes and
what discovery theyhadtoprevent their communica-
tions. TheEnemy were unable tofindoutanything
about theAmerican plans. They demanded toknow
whathadhappened tothecaptured aviators, whether
theywere living ordead. Supreme Commander Gor-
donrefused togiveanyinformation whatsoever about
prisoners ;replied thatreports ofanything inregard to
prisoners orplanes would bemade after thewarwas
overand after theEnemy hadsurrendered andwere
ready toleave our soil. This greatly aroused theJap-
anese, Spanish andGermans whodecided toredouble
their efforts totakeDetroit andthen attack theEastern
Coast oftheUnited States.

Supreme Commander Gordon went toNewYork on
January 1st,1932, leaving Colonel Morrison incharge
inDetroit andordering General Pearson toDetroit to

Supreme Commander Gordon accompanied only by
Colonel Edna Kennelworth made the first flight in

Hehad alsodiscovered how tosend ships thru theair

Germany again. France waswellprepared withalarge
number ofairplanes. Theattack started andtheywere
successful. When thisnews reached theenemy head-
quarters intheUnited States therewasgreat consterna-

United States refusing toaccept peace terms, but felt
thatFrance could nothold outlong alone. Spain and
Japan ordered their reserve planes fromhome toEng-
landandGermany tohelp fight France. The "Tel-

across theAtlantic toattack France. Supreme Com-
mander Gordon ordered theFrench togooutandmeet
theattack.Agreat battle raged over theAtlantic for
hours with theFrench winning. Thousands ofthe
enemy planes wentdown intotheocean. TheSpanish
andJapanese withdrew. This stopped Germany and
England from striking back atFrance. Thenews

Colonel Kennel worth letthem approach within area-
sonable distance andthenturned loose thesleeping gas
among alltheenemy planes. Theaviators immediately
went tosleep andtheplanes alldropped slowly tothe
earth andsome landed onthewater andwere not
damaged. Hundreds afterhundreds ofplanes followed
up,eachonesharing thesame fate. Ofalltheplanes
sent outbytheenemy, notonereturned. Colonel
Kennelworth reported toSupreme Commander Gordon
thatBoston was safe,—thatthere hadnotbeen theloss
ofonelifeandnotabomb hadbeendropped upon the
city.
TheCommanders oftheAllied Enemy armies were
unable togetanyreport ofwhathadhappened tothe
planes thatwent toattack Boston. They waited until

thenextday ;andwhen notaplane returned andthere
wasnoreport ofanykind, decided thatthesame fate
hadbefallen them asattheattack onDetroit ;thatthe
Americans certainly hadsomething bywhich theywere
destroying every shipandplane which attacked them.
Thiswasunusual andunheard of.Thefactthatthou-
sands andthousands ofplanes hadattacked Boston and
notonehadescaped capture ordestruction, made it
plain thatYankee ingenuity haddiscovered something
thatwasturning thetideofwarintheir favor. They
nowknew thattheyhadmade thegreatest mistake by
notpressing ushard after thefallofChicago. They
should have refused togrant the15days' armistice
without demanding thesurrender oftheEastern Coast.
Another great mistake wasthelongdelay between the
attack onDetroit andtheattack onBoston. Thishad
enabled theAmericans togetbetter prepared. There
wasnodenying thepainful truth. Something must
bedoneanddone quickly. They decided toorder every
plane that could possibly bespared from thePacific
Coast andfrom thelines extending froml^ew Orleans
toSt.Louis andChicago; toconcentrate asupreme
attack upon"NewYork andWashington, making Wash-
ington thefinal goal. Planes were concentrated and
mother ships anchored outintheAtlantic Ocean to
prepare fortheattack upon IN'ewYork City. Thiswas
tobethegreatest battle inallhistory.
Onthenight ofJune Yth,Supreme Commander Gor-
donhadgrown tiredfrom hislong vigil waiting for
anattack upon "New York. Heplaced Colonel Edna

listened inandsoonhadtheplans oftheenemy. She
knew thatSupreme Commander Gordon needed restand
shedidnotawaken him until early next morning.
When heentered theheadquarters ontopoftheMam-
mouth Building, shesaluted himand said,"Supreme
Commander Gordon, this isgoing tobeagreat birthday
foryou.Theenemy isgoing toattackNewYork City
with probably 100,000 airplanes andyouandIare
alone todefend it.Itwillbethedayofalldays for

discovered how totake electricity from theairandcom-
pleted themachine forsending anelectric discharge

lowed bygreater successes. This attack upon'NewYork
isgoing tobethegreatest inhistory because thegain
willbethegreatest should theenemy win. Should
they failtheir cause islost,andthey will fail." She
sawthatSupreme Commander Gordon wasveryhappy
andthat there wasanote ofconfidence inhistone.
While sheshuddered tothink ofwhatmight happen if
they should fail, sheknew thatSupreme Commander
Gordon hadgreat confidence inthe^^Demon ofDeath'^
andthesleeping gasmachine andknewwhat theywould
do,because healoneknew allthesecrets ofworking
these machines.
lAt8o'clock ontheevening ofJune 8th,Supreme
Commander Gordon stood near the^^Demon ofDeath''
watching hisdifferent instruments andsoon noticed on
theother side oftheroom theradio interceptor start
towork. Hestepped uptoitandlistened, caught the
orders going from thedifferent enemy headquarters,
giving instructions forthecombined attack onl^ew

gave instructions for alltheelectric lights tobekept
onallnight and allbuildings tobewell lighted toshow

them nottooverlook theMammouth Building which
was110 stories high; thathewould bethere alone,
waiting forthem todestroy thebuilding.
GiGAiTTic Attack on!N'ewYork City
When thenews reached theenemy, theyknew that in
someway their plans hadleaked out,but itwastoo
latenow tomake anychange andtodelay attack might
mean defeat later, sotheorders were carried out.
About 10minutes after 10o'clock. Supreme Com-
mander Gordon sighted the first airplane ofthe fleet
approaching 40or50milesuptheHudson River. He
watched them until they gotwithin about 20miles of
!N"ewYork City, near Yonkers, thenheslowly swung
the"Demon ofDeath" around ontherevolving base
andturned ontherays, atthesame time starting the
sleeping gasmachine working. Heswept theterritory
for50or60miles inevery direction, andastherays
from the"Demon ofDeath" struck theenemy planes,
their motors leaped intoaliquid flame. Supreme Com-

Commander Gordon swung the"Demon ofDeath"
around andwatched theapproach oftheenemy planes
astheycame outfrom theAtlantic Ocean andcrossed
Fire Island. He letthem getwithin 30to40miles
astheycameupacross theGreat South Bay, thenhe
again turned loose the"Demon ofDeath." Swiftly the
planes wentdown inflames, ending theattack from the
ocean.
Hewatched alittle while longer andsaw across
Staten Island another flock ofplanes which heknew
wascoming from Southern headquarters. Hecalled
Colonel Edna Kennelworth and said: "This time
youmay operate ^Spitfire' anddestroy theSouthern
wing." Shewasalittle nervous atfirstbutknowing
what this great machine could do,sheturned iton,
slowly lowered andraised it,moving totheright and
left, until shegauged thedistance oftheapproaching
planes. Onebyoneshesawtheir motors turn toliquid

powerful glasses toward theSouth andsawthattheair
was clear. Turning around hesaid: "Edna, youare
awonderful woman andIamhappy tohaveyoutake
thispart insaving your country. This isthedayof
women andtheir influence must help towinwar for-

ofallthese bravemenfrom somany nations should

thousands, Icould seesome were English, German,
Spanish, Austrian, Eussian, Japanese, Turkish, and

teachman alesson sothathewill cease togotowar
anymore, itdoesseem ashame thatweshould takethe
lives ofanymore ofthese innocent menwhoareforced
byselfish rulers oftheir countries toattack us."
'^You arequite right/' theSupreme Commander said.
"Your noble husband invented thesleeping gasbecause
itwasmydesire toprotectmycountry andwinthewar
with aslittle lossoflifeaspossible. From thistime
on,nomore lives willbesacrificed. Wewillusethe
sleeping gas,put alltheattacking aviators tosleep for

thatthere willbeanother final attack upon 'NewYork

honor ofusing thesleeping gasmachine andending
thefinal attack upon thegreat City ofNewYork with-
outlossofany life."
About thetime thatColonel Kennelworth wastrans-
ferred from Cincinnati toBoston, General Pearson had
been sent toCincinnati tooperate theTunnel machine
from there. Immediately before the final attack on
NewYork City,Supreme Commander Gordon ordered
General Pearson toswing theTunnel machine tothe
Eastandestablish aTunnel thrutheAirbetween New
York andCincinnati, informing himthattheexpected
thefinal attack upon IsTewYork would come over the
mountains ofPennsylvania andthat this final attack
would befrom theWest ;thathewanted aTunnel thru
;
theAir atleast 30miles wide sothathecould protect
theJersey shores andprevent theattack upon ISTew

Tunnel wasready toreceive theinvading army ofplanes
and airships. Heknew that ISlewYork wasnow safe
andawaited thefinalcombined attack oftheEnemy
planes thatwould come across from St.Louis andChi-
cago tomeetontheWestern sideoftheHudson River.
About 12o'clock hesighted theenemy planes across
theWestern coast ofJersey moving intriangle form,
andknew that itwasthecombined forces withprobably
more than 50,000 planes ready forthe final attack.
Swiftly theyapproached, closer and closer. Heplayed
hispowerful searchlight upon their glistening wings,
until theywere within 15to20miles of'New York.
Fearing that they might start dropping bombs on
l^ewark, Jersey Cityandthetowns ontheother side
before attacking New York, headjusted theTunnel
thrutheAiruntil itwashighenough toreach theenemy
planes fiying atthehighest altitude; then turned to
Colonel Edna Kennelworth and said: "Turn onthe
sleeping gasmachine. TheTunnel isready andasthe

Tunnel thru theAirandremain suspended without the
planes being destroyed orthelossofany lives. This
willbeasilent, painless victory, but itwilldemonstrate
ourpower totheenemy andtheworld."
Slowly and carefully, with atrembling hand, she
swung thepowerful gasdistributing machine intoaction
andasshesawtheplanes coming bythethousands begin
slowly toplunge into theTunnel thru theAir, she

ofherhusband, whoinvented it,andforthelove of

donnaming hisgreat ship'^Marie theAngel ofMercy"
andthen realized whatwasinhismind atthetime;
that thesleeping gasshould benamed the"God of
Mercy'' because itwaswinning thewar inahumane
waywithout taking human lives. Hermind wentback
tothegreat destruction ofLosAngeles andSanFran-
ciscoandabove all,sheremembered thelossofmore
than amillion lives atthebattle ofChicago; how
merciless theenemy hadbeen, sparing notthelives of
women orchildren. Wewerenowindeed merciful unto
ourfoesandheaping coals offireupon their heads and
shebelieved thiswould beagreat example totheworld.
Sheknew thattheenemy hadused poisoned gasofall
kinds, poisoning thewater andfoods inthevarious
cities andresorted toevery means todestroy both life
andproperty.
Asthese thoughts were flitting thruhermind, bat-
talion after battalion ofplanes followed andshewas
pouring thesleeping gasintothenoses oftheaviators
andtheplanes were diving intotheTunnel. Thiswas
indeed agreat victory andshewasglad tohelpaccom-

machines hadworked successfully andperfectly. The
sleeping gashaddone itssilent, painless work andthe
army ofmore than 50,000 planes—thegiant attack
from theWest—rested safely intheTunnel thru the

ingwith hishand upon thelevers oftheTunnel
machine, with thepowerful searchlights playing upon
theenemy planes, andwatching thru hisfield glasses
theplanes asthey dived swiftly intotheTunnel thru
theAir after theaviators inhaled thesleeping gas.
When thelastplane hadlanded safely intheTunnel,
hisfeatures relaxed and hisfaceshowed asmile of
victory. His first thought was ofMarie, hisnext
thought was ofhisoldfriend Walter Kennelworth.
Hesent the first message ofthevictory over his
secret radio tohim. "Theenemy hasattacked iN'ew
Yorkfrom four sides, more than 100,000 strong. The
^Demon ofDeath' hasdone itswork. TheTunnel
machines haveperformed amiracle. More than50,000
aviators aresleeping inournets. Your great discovery
hasmade thisapainless victory. Edna, your noble
wife, performed thepainless herculean taskandplayed
herpart inthefinal stage ofthegreat victory."
Onreceiving thismessage Colonel Kennelworth was
overjoyed, knowing that itmeant thattheendofthe
warwasnear. Hisreplywasbrief—^^Congratulations,
Robert Gordon. Love toEdna. Ihope thatyoumay
yethaveMarie toshare withyouinthegreat victory."
Supreme Commander Gordon's nextthought wasof

ofSanFrancisco. Thenextinformed himofthegreat

great service thatyouhaverendered ourcountry. You

When reports came toheadquarters inWashington
thattheenemy hadattacked E'ewYork withmore than
100,000 airplanes; thattheyhad allbeen destroyed or
captured; that ISFewYorkwas safe,andprepared for
further attacks, there wasgreat rejoicing. ThePresi-
dent oftheUnited States hurried totheWar Office,
ordered theswiftest plane toconvey him tol^ewYork
City tocongratulate Supreme Commander Gordon. He
wasgiven afastplane which could travel more than
300miles perhour.
After thelastattack andSupreme Commander Gor-
donhadrelaxed from theterrific strain, hewalked to
hisdeskandpicked uptheBible. Turning toEzekiel
5:2,heread :"Thou shaltburn with fireathird part
inthemidst ofthecity,when thedays ofthesiege are
fulfilled; andthou shalt take athird part, andsmite
about itwith aknife; andathird part thou shalt
scatter inthewind ;andIwilldraw outasword after
them." Heknew thatEzekiel wastalking about the
Tunnel thru theAirandthescattering ofathird part
ofthearmy inwind andthattheywere caught while

OR,LOOKING BACKFROM 1940 369
traveling intheTunnel thru tlieAir. Then heread
Chapter 17 :3:"Thus saith theLord God,Agreat
eagle with great wings, long-winged, fulloffeathers,
which haddivers colours, came untoLehanon, andtook
thehighest branch ofthecedar." This referred to
Uncle Sam, thegreat eagle thatwaswinning thewar.
Thecedar referred tothetallbuilding of110 stories
where Supreme Commander Gordon nowhadhishead-
quarters.
Henextread Ezekiel 31 :4:"The waters madehim
great, thedeep sethimuponhighwithherrivers run-
ninground about hisplants, and sent outher little
rivers unto allthetrees ofthefield." Heknew that
thisreferred toEngland when shehadbeenthemistress
oftheseas, butthatUncleSamhadproved tobethe
eagle oftheairandwould conquer allnations onthe
face oftheearth.
Heread Ezekiel 33 :21 :"And itcame topassinthe
twelfth year ofourcaptivity, inthetenth month, inthe
fifthdayofthemonth, thatonehadescaped outof
Jerusalem came untome,saying, The city issmitten."
Heinterpreted thistomean theCity ofChicago where
theenemy gained their lastgreat victory.
Then read Ezekiel 37:22:"And Iwillmake them
onenation inthelandupon themountains ofIsrael;
andoneking shall beking tothem all ;andthey shall
benomore twonations, neither shall theybedivided
intotwokingdoms, anymore atall."Hewassurethat
thismeant that l^orth andSouth America were to
unite allnations oftheworld andthattherewastobe

Hecontinued with Ezekiel 39:11: "And itshall
come topass inthat day, thatIwillgiveuntoGoga
place there ofgraves inIsrael, thevalley ofthepassen-
gersontheeastofthesea;and itshall stopthenoses
ofthepassengers; andthere shall theybury Gog,and
allhismultitude ;andthey shall call it.TheValley of
Hamon-gog." Hethought that this referred tothe
battle ofNew York. Where itsaid "itshall stopthe
noses ofthepassengers," thisreferred tothesleeping
gas,which hadcaused theaviators tofall into the
Tunnel thrutheAir,andindeed themultitude hadbeen
buried above thevalley andmeadows ofNew Jersey.
Again inthe39thChapter: 9thverse: "Shall goforth
and shall setonfireandburn theweapons, both the
shields andthebucklers, thebowsandthearrows, and
thehandstaves andthespears, andthey shallburnthem
with fireseven years.'^ Thismeant the"Demon of
Death'' which hadburned upthemotors oftheattack-
ingairplanes.
Hethenwondered when thewarwould end.He
knew thatDaniel's 70weeks indicated theendin1932,
orabout3%years from thetime thatwar firstbroke
outinEurope in1928. Heread Daniel 7:12: "As
concerning therestofthebeasts, theyhadtheir domin-
iontaken away: yettheir liveswere prolonged fora
season andtime." And again the25th verse: "And
heshall speak great words against theMost High, and
shallwear outthesaints oftheMost High, andthink
tochange times andlaws ;andthey shall begiven into
hishand, until atimeandtimes andthedividing of

cycles that atime oraseason referred tointheBible
meant 360days, 360years, or360degrees,—ameasure
known andusedbytheastrologers inolden times and
stillunderstood andusedbymodern astrologers for
measuring time. Heknew that half atimemeant
180degrees, 180daysoryears, because Ezekiel hadsaid
thattheLord hadappointed adayforayear.He
figured thatAmerica began with thediscovery byCo-
lumbus in1492andthat inOctober, 1932, would be
440years since thediscovery. Themeasurement used
thruout theBible wasbyscores andman's span of
lifewasthree score years andten,andthatfourhun-
dredandforty years equalled twenty-two scores, leav-
ingtwo scores, orforty years, more forthecompletion
ofthejubilee years. HereadMatthew 18:21 and22:
"Then came Peter tohim,andsaid, Lord,how oftshall
mybrother sinagainst me,andIforgive him? till
seven times? Jesus saith unto him, Isaynotunto
thee. Until seven times ;but.Until seventy times seven."
Robert figured that seventy times seven meant four
hundred andninety years from thediscovery ofAmer-
icauntilwewould cease fighting, forgive ourbrothers
and liveinpeace. Heknew that theseventh period
wasalways ajubilee period, that there wasajubilee
period ofseven years attheendofeach forty-ninth
yearperiod andthattherewasagreat period offorty-
nine jubilee years attheendofseven times seventy;
thatthesixth period would endin1933andthatfrom
1933 to1982would betheforty-nine years ofthegreat
jubilee following theendofwarsandtheUnited King-
dom oftheWorld.

Heread Daniel 7:25: "And lieshall speak great
words against theMost High, and shallwear outthe
saints oftheMost High, andthink tochange times and
laws: andthey shall begiven into hishand, until a
timeandtimes andthedividing oftime." Then read
Daniel 12:7: "And Iheard theman clothed inlinen,
which wasupon thewaters oftheriver,when heheld
uphisrighthand andhislefthand unto heaven, and
sware byhimthat liveth forever, that itshall befora
time, times, andanhalf; andwhen heshall have ac-
complished toscatter thepower oftheholy people, all
these things shall befinished." Hefigured thatatime
equalled twenty years orascore, andthatatime, times,
equalled fourhundred years, andhalfatime equalled
tenyears.
Again, Daniel 12:11 and12:"And from thetime
that thedaily sacrifice shall betaken away, andthe
abomination thatmaketh desolate setup,there shall be
athousand twohundred andninety days. Blessed is
hethatwaiteth, andcometh tothethousand three hun-
dredand fiveandthirty days." Twelve hundred and
ninety days aretobeadded tothetime thewarbroke
outinEurope in1928 andthethirteen hundred and
thirty-five days being forty-five days more, theblessed
jubilee days willfollow from thetime thewarended
in1932 until thegreat celebration andsigning ofpeace
and establishing thebrotherhood ofman. Heread
Daniel 9:24 :"Seventy weeks aredetermined upon
thypeople, andupon thyholy city, tofinish thetrans-
gression, and tomake anend ofsins, and tomake
reconciliation foriniquity, andtobring ineverlastingI

andtoanoint theMost Holy."
Thisagain proved thatfourhundred andninety years
from thediscovery ofAmerica, thatthere should bean
endofsins,anendofwarandoftroublesome times.
Ezekiel 4:6and6:^Tor Ihave laidupon theethe
years oftheir iniquity, according tothenumber ofthe
days, threehundred andninety days ;soshaltthoubear
theiniquity ofthehouse ofIsrael. Andwhen thou
hastaccomplished them, lieagain onthyright side,and
thou shalt beartheiniquity ofthehouse ofJudah forty
days :Ihaveappointed theeeachdayforayear." This
made itplain that adaywas tobeused inmeasuring
years andthatthere were tobeforty days orforty years
after peace forajubilee period inwhich thesinsofthe
pastwere tobeatoned for.
Ten years after thearmistice in!N'ovember, 1918,
would bring ustol^ovember, 1928, orhalf ascore, and
from ISTovember, 1928 to1932 areindicated thetrouble-
some times fortheUnited States. May, 1928 toJuly,
1928, areveryimportant andtroublesome periods when
thenominations forPresident oftheUnited States
will arouse thepeople and start atime oftrouble.
Using thetime ofthree score years andten,anddoub-

window. The President toldSupreme Commander
Gordon thathehadneither seennorheard ofsuch aship
before andaskedhimwhere itcame from. Robert said,
"Mr. President, thisshipwas buijt according tothe
plan laiddown byEzekiel intheBible. Iworked on
itforyears andcompleted itjustbefore thewarbroke
out. Itsmost useful work isyettobedone." Supreme
Commander Gordon then explained fully theworking
ofthe"Demon ofDeath" tothePresident.
They stepped upon board "Marie theAngel ofMercy,"
sailed outacross Long Island, slowed theplane down,
drifted verylowandpassed overthethousands ofair-
planes which hadbeen destroyed.
They sailed overStaten Island andsawthewrecks of
theplanes which hadbeendestroyed there. Thenswung
uptheHudson River above Yonkers, descended close to
thewater andanchored intheair.ThePresident had
never beenonanairship thatwasanchored intheair
andwasamazed atSupreme Comtmander Gordon's mar-
velous invention. Hehanded thePresident apair of
powerful field glasses andtoldhim totake alook. The
riverwasalmost choked with thewrecks oftheairplanes
which hadgonedown defying the"Demon ofDeath."
Bodies ofaviators wearing theuniforms ofthevarious
nations were floating upon thewaters. When theSu-
preme Commander explained tothePresident thathe
believed thatnotoneoftheenemy's planes hadescaped,
hemarveled atthewonderful invention andthefact
thattwomenandalonewoman could accomplish such
afeat. Supreme Commander Gordon then said :"Mr.
President, your greatest sight isyettocome."

Hethen started "Marie tlieAngel ofMercy," sailed
outacross theNew Jersey hills, slowed down thebig
shipandentered theTunnel thru theAir. There the
greatest sight thathuman eyeshad ever witnessed
greeted thePresident. They passed slowly thru the
Tunnel where there were thousands andthousands of
planes unharmed suspended intheairwith theaviators
allsound asleep. TheSupreme Commander then said:
"This workwasdonebythesleeping gas.Asthisgiant
horde ofprobably 50,000 planes moving insections of
hundreds andthousands, onefollowing after another,
tried toattack IsTewYork, General Pearson andmyself
worked theTunnel machines andColonel Edna Ken-
nelworth operated thesleeping gasmachine. Youcan
seetheeffective work andourmission ofmercy. We
have nottakenhuman lifeandhavegained thegreatest
victory intheworld. These aviators will sleep for
seven daysandthenawake unharmed. There willbe
no illeffects ofthesleeping gas.Wewill ofcourse
remove theairships andaviators totheWilson, Cool-
idge, Roosevelt, Lowden, Harding andWashington air-
fields andwhen theyawake they willbeourprisoners
andtheenemy's airships willbeinourpossession."
ThePresident wasastounded. Hehadnever dreamed
thatmancouldmake suchmarvelous inventions. Turn-
ingtoSupreme Commander Gordon andgrasping his
hand, hesaid: "You havebeen inspired byAlmighty
God.You areaninstrument inhishands tosave this
country according toGod's plan." TheSupreme Com-
mander replied thathehadalways feltthatwayand
hadnever taken any credit tohimself; that since he

andknew from itthat thiswarwasinevitable ;thathe
hadspent histimeandmoney tocomplete these inven-
tions forthedayhiscountry would needthem.
Onthewayback,Supreme Commander Gordon told
thePresident thattheMarie theAngel ofMercy could
make aspeed of1000 miles anhourandthathecould
easily goround theworld in24hours. Ontheir return
allwasquiet inNewYork City.Nooneknewwhathad
happened thatnight. ThePresident could notfindwords
toexpress hisappreciation forthiswonderful work.He
asked theSupreme Commander what hisfuture plans
were. Supreme Commander Gordon toldthePresident
toread theBible, especially Daniel's prophecy andthe
book ofEzekiel, andhewould know whatwasyetto
take place. Itwasagreed thatthenews ofthesuccess
with the^'Demon ofDeath'' andthesleeping gasma-
chine was tobekept secret andthatthePresident was
theonlyonetoknow ofKobert's great invention.
ThePresident returned toWashington onthefore-
noon ofJune 9th,feeling much elated overthewonder-
fulvictory, proud ofhisnative landandthankful that
theDivine Power hadgiventhem theman ofthehour

was over, hislifework would befinished. Without
Marie, there would benothing left,nothing more to
work for.Supreme Commander Gopdon knew thatthere
would benomore attacks thatday,soheordered Colonel
Edna Kennel worth togetsome sleep. Hecommuni-
cated with Colonel Kennelworth inBoston andfound
that there hadbeen nofurther attacks there. The
Colonel reported thathewasready andwaiting toput
tosleepmore oftheenemy assoon asthey arrived.
The Allied Enemy headquarters atthe different
points intheUnited States were absolutely without any
news astowhathadhappened toalltheplanes and air-
ships thathadbeen sentouttoattackNew York, but
inthiscase,they feltthatnonewswasgoodnews. They
were trying ineverywaywith thewireless andradio
toreach thecommanders ofthedifferent fleets butnot
awordwasreceived.
Ontheafternoon ofJune 9th,when notawordhad
beenheard fromanyoftheships orplanes sentoutthe

Enemy headquarters were ingloom. Hope wasgiving
way todespair. They feared thatthedisaster atDe-

hasbeen lostinthis attack against New York, our
cause seems hopeless. The facts aredesperate butwe
must facethem. Letnofurther move bemade until
weknow more about what theYankees have."
Supreme Commander Gordon hadmadeuphismind
thathewould keep everything secret andnot letthe
enemy know anything, buthedispatched amessage by
radio toenemy headquarters reading:
Verymuch disappointed. Lost agood night^s sleep lastnight
waiting foryourarmy totakeNewYork City.When may
weexpect thepleasure ofavisitfrom your planes?
This mysterious message was asmuch amystery tothe
enemy astheletter thatRobert found onthestreet in
Paris wastohim. The fleet sentouttoattack Boston
hadnever returned andnoword hadeverbeen heard
ofthem. France hadbeen instructed bySupreme Com-
mander Gordon tocease attacking andawait further
instructions. Everything wasquiet ontheother side
andGermany andEngland were awaiting reports ofthe
success ofthecampaign oftheUnited States before mak-
ingfurther attacks onFrance.
Onthemorning ofJune 13th theaviators whohad
been puttosleepbythesleeping gasaround Boston,
awoke. Theywere feeling good. Theyknew thatsome-
thing hadputthem tosleep suddenly butdidnotknow
thattheyhadslept seven daysandnights instead ofone

hadbeengiven thatnoharm should bedoneanyofthe
aviators when they awoke. Scouting planes were sent

butafewoftheplanes were permitted toescape and
return totheheadquarters oftheenemy. When they
reported thatwhile theywere attacking Boston thenight
before, they suddenly went tosleep and theplanes
dropped totheearth andwater, theywereinformed by
theCommanders thattheyhadbeenaway oneweek.
Thiswasagreat blow totheenemy andtheyknew
now that theAmericans hadsome kind ofasleeping
gaswhich washarmless andwould putmen tosleep
andkeepthem asleep for7days. Theenemy had all
kinds ofpoisonous gases andbombs, buttheyhadnever
discovered agastoputpeople asleep foraweek, then
awake without any illeffects. Theynow realized what
Supreme Commander Gordon's answer meant,—^that it
wassomenew discoveries which theUnited States had
made that caused them tofight onandnotaccede
toanypeace terms. After days ofwaiting, scout-
ingand trying tosecure information astowhat
hadhappened, theattack onNewYork was lefta

CHAPTER XXXIII
TIMEdrifted along until theearly part ofJuly
without anyfurther attack bytheenemy, butSu-
preme Commander Gordon believed that theywould
make another attack soon before giving up.Hewas
simply watching andwaiting, biding histime. The
United StatesArmy scouting planes reported thatthe
enemy scouts weregoing outmore frequently eachnight
andsome ofthemhadbeen seen50,000 or60,000 feet
intheair.They thought thattheywere getting ready
tomake another attack andwere trying togetaline
onwhat theUnited States forces were planning todo.
TheSupreme Commander went toWashington totest
outthe"Demon ofDeath" which hadbeen installed in
theCapitol Building andfound itingood working
order.Asleeping gasdistributing machine andthe
Tunnel machine hadbeen setupthereandhealsotested
them out.
Inview ofthesplendid work donebyColonel Edna
Kennelworth atthetime oftheattack onISTewYork
City,Supreme Commander Gordon decided tosendher
toWashington andputherincharge ofthesleeping
gasdistributing machine, the"Demon ofDeath," and
theTunnel machine. Heinstructed herthat ifan
attack cameupon Washington, shewasnottousethe
"Demon ofDeath" unless thesleeping gasfailed orthey

failed togettheenemy aviators intotheTunnel thru
theAir.Hebelieved that ifattack cameuponWash-
ington, itwould bethelastandendthewar. Because
hiscountry hadever stood forloveand liberty, ifits
Capitol was attacked hewanted ittobesaved bya
bloodless victory. Itwould meanmuch totheUnited
States infuture years iftheseatofgovernment could
beprotected without taking thelifeofoneoftheenemy.
With theTunnel machine inl^ewYork, another onein
Cincinnati andathird machine inWashington, D.C,
Jiewould beablefrom ISTewYork City toplace aTunnel
thru theAirinevery direction around Washington to
capture theinvading army ofplanes. Colonel Edna
Kennelworth said that shethought hewasplacing on
hershoulders agreat responsibility, butthat ifhehad
confidence inher,shewould goanddoherbest.He
toldherthatshecould notfailandthattherewasnoth-
ingtofear ;that itwould bemuch easiernow toprotect
Washington than itwasl^ewYork from attack. So
Colonel Edna Kennelworth went toWashington. She
arrived there onJuly 2nd,anddidnothave long to
wait before seeing action.
Battle ofWashington"
Theenemy waslosing confidence anddecided torisk
50,000 planes, thebest thatthey had,onaconcerted
attack upon Washington. They figured that ifthey
could take theCapitol, itwould beatelling blowand
helpthem ontofurther victory. Thiswas tobea

andtheattack would have agreater demoralizing effect
onthepeople thruout thecountry. July 4th,Inde-
pendence Day,wasthetime selected fortheattack. The
planwastosendone fleetupthePotomac, have another
fleetcomedown thePotomac from theNorth andNorth-
westandthethird wing come across byBaltimore.
Colonel Edna Kennelworth wasondutywhen the
Tel-Talk buzzed and ascouting plane reported to
herthattheenemy were approaching inlargenumbers
upthePotomac. Shehadnever operated thesleeping
gasmachine indaylight before, butknew that itwould
work just aseffectively. Having seentheattack upon
NewYork andknowing how swiftly oneattack fol-
lowed theother, sherealized thatshemustwork fast.She
adjusted thegasmachine toward theenemy approach-
ingdown thePotomac and set itforacertain range,
about 76miles. Shelooked thruhertelescope andsaw
theenemy when theywere about 50'miles away and
decided toletgothesleeping gas.Sheswept itquickly

entire fleet w^as safely asleep intheTunnel thru the

making from Baltimore inadirect lineforWashington.

hadworked wonderfully andthattheTunnel thru the
Airheld incaptivity thousands oftheenemy's airships
andplanes. Almost before shehadfinished making her

planes ever seenwasapproaching from theWest and
Northwest. Knowing that thiswasacombined fleet

was tobethesupreme test. The firstformation ap-
proached with about 1000 planes. Swiftly and silently,
thegasmachine did itswork andtheywentdown into
theTunnel. Thencame thesecond^ third, andfourth

gonedown andnotmore than onehour's timehad
elapsed. When itwasoverwith,Edna realized thatshe
hadnotbeen ahuman being during this ordeal, that

country. When sheknew thattheCapitol ofherbe-

Thenewshadbeen flashed toalltheDepartments and

inthisattack andnotoneofthem escaped, thePresi-
dentandArmy officers breathed agreat sigh ofrelief
andknew that thismeant certain victory fortheUnited
States because theenemy hadconcentrated their attack
onNewYork andWashington with their best planes,
andhadveryfewlargebombing planes left,and ifthis
wasnottheendofthewar, itwasthebeginning of
theend.
ThePresident andhisCabinet rushed totheCapitol
Building tocongratulate Colonel Edna Kennelworth.
They found hercarefully powdering hernose.Bythis
time shewascalmand collected andprepared forthe
unexpected reception, butwasoverwhelmed with the
suddenness ofthearrival ofhigh officials. Shehad

Ontheafternoon ofJuly 4ththePresident ofthe
United States issued aproclamation tothepeople, tell-
ingthem ofthewonderful victory inWashington and
assuring them thatthecountry was safe,and setaside
thefollowing three days asholidays tocelebrate and

lonewoman, Edna Kennel worth, with these inventions
hadprotected Washington from destruction and cap-

ThePresident's Proclamation wasgiven tothenews-

When thePresident declared aholiday, Supreme
Commander Gordon decided that thiswasthetime to
lettheenemy know what ourstrength was asitwas
nolonger necessary tokeep thesecret ahout ournew
wonderful inventions. Heordered theinvisible noise-
lessplanes toloadupwithhundreds ofthousands of
newspapers which toldofthegreat victory, sailatgreat
altitudes overtheenemy's lines intheUnited States and
bombard them with these newspapers. Heordered
Colonel Morrison andColonel Manson totakecharge of
theplanes which were todistribute thepapers overthe
enemy's lines. Ordered them tosailover theCity of
Mexico and distribute papers over theenemy's head-
quarters there. TheSupreme Commander feltthat this
wastheend, infactheknew it,because after reading
over Ezekiel again hesaw that theprophecies were
about allfulfilled andthat inashort time themillen-
niumwould dawn andtheworld would beatpeace. He
readChapter 10:9and21;
And theeherubims lifted uptheir wings andmounted up

Heknew tliat thiswas tlieglory referred toforthe
United States andthatEzekiel's prophecy, Chapter 14,
21st verse, hadbeen fulfilled. Itreads asfollows:
Forthus saith theLord God:Howmuch morewhen I

that allofthese things hadhappened.

From there heproceeded tothebeautiful city of
Vienna andhaving thepeople removed from thebuild-

buildings down. Discharging sleeping gasfrom his
machine, hesaidgood-bye toVienna andproceeded to
Moscow.
Thepooranduneducated people ofRussia hadbeen
warned ofhiscoming. Thenewspapers toldthemwhat
hadbeenhappening inother cities, butthepeople re-
fused tobelieve thattheywould notbedestroyed. Many
ofthem rushed tothewaters anddrowned themselves.
Others went totheforests tohide. Moscow wasmore
excited than ever before. People hadbeenpraying day
andnight before hearrived. Finally when hewas
overMoscow, hesentaradio message thattheyshould
clear alltheimportant buildings which hewasgoing
todestroy. Hedescended verylowandlocated the
buildings andwhen hehadbeen notified thatthepeople
hadbeenmoved tosafety, turned onthe"Demon of
Death." Asthebuildings leapt into flames andthe
people could seethem, theywere sure that thiswasthe
endoftheworld andthatGodwasdestroying itby
fire,because theywere unable toseethesource from
which thedestruction wascoming, thedestroying rays

thathewasgoing toopen theDardanelles from theair;
anddestroy thebattleships intheBlack Sea.When he
arrived and allbuildings were cleared, people were
greatly frightened andsome ofthem were praying to
America's God tosave them. Supreme Commander

then proceeded todestroy alltheir largest buildings,
discharged thedeath rays intothewater andblewup

have thefinalandgreatest demonstration ofthepower
ofMarie theAngel ofMercy. TheMexicans andSpan-
iardsknew thatSupreme Commander Gordon wasborn
intheState ofTexas. Theyremembered theBattle ofthe
Alamo andGoliad. Thepoor class ofMexicans refused
tobelieve after Mexico hadjoined withJapan and
Spain against theUnited States, thatanyTexan would
spare their lives. Theyhadprayed dayandnight since
they learned that theSupreme Commander ofthe
United States withMarie theAngel ofMercy was to
visit them. Hetoldthem that thismachine took its
power from theairandthat therayswere powerful
enough tomeltdown themountains andthathewould

CHAPTER XXXV
THEAllied Enemy generals and officers knowing
what could happen after thelosses atNewYork
andWashington obeyed theinstructions ofSupreme
Commander Gordon andmoved toaplace ofsafety.
After waiting three daysandfinding that their armies
were stillasleep theygathered near their various head-
quarters inISTew Orleans, St.Louis, Chicago, SanEran-
ciscoandprayed fordeliverance. They realized that
thegreatest power oftheuniverse wasnowinthehands
oftheUnited States. Most ofthem credited thispower
toanactofGod,andnottoman. They hadnotyet
heard whathadhappened inallthecities oftheworld
where theMarie theAngel ofMercy hadvisited.
Lateonthe7thdaytheAllied Armies oftheenemy
began toawake. Each dayfollowing forthenext 6
days, thepeople inonecityafter another oftheforeign
countries where hehadvisited awoke. Supreme Com-
mander Gordon released anelectric light control and
thecities werenolonger indarkness. Allwireless and
radio stations refused totakeanymessages except what
concerned news inregard totheMarie theAngel of
Mercy andwhathadhappened allovertheworld.

ThePresident andtheWarCouncil decided that itwas
nowtime topermit allnewspapers topublish thenews
allovertheUnited States and letthepeople know just

Thousands ofmessages poured intoSupreme Com-
mander Gordon. Theworld was attheSupreme Com-
mander^s feet.Hewashailed asthegreatest man since
Jesus Christ.
OnAugust 4th,1932, allofthecities intheworld
where Supreme Commander Gordon had destroyed
buildings, wereheard from. Reports showed thatevery-
thingwasnormal andthatnoliveswere lost. Messages
were pouring infrom every part oftheworld tothe
Allied Enemy Commanders tomake peace with the
United States onanyterms andnever permit thereturn
ofMarie theAngel ofMercy. TheCommanders of
theAllied Enemy armies dispatched messages tothe
President atWashington, asking foranarmistice and
peace terms onanyconditions. ThePresident replied:
Peace terms areoutofmyhands. When thiscountry was
indire peril andourcause seemed hopeless and lost,—when
yourdemands were totakeourcountry, ourname, ourhonor,—atthattimeweplaced ourfate inthehands ofaloneman

Thecommunication wassent toSupreme Commander
Gordon. Hecalled aconference todiscuss peace terms.
ThePresident, Cabinet officers and alltheArmy and
Government officials attended. When theconference
convened, General Pearson arose andsaid: ^^When we
turned over theSupreme Command oftheArmies of

GodandImake amotion thatwesaynothing, offer
noadvice, butleave everything inyour hands. What-
everterms ofpeace youmake, wewillgladly abide by
them.'' ^
When hehadfinished talking, Colonel Manson arose
andsaid :"Isecond thatmotion. Letusmake thevote
unanimous byallrising.'' Everyman roseimmediately.
ThePresident grasped Supreme Commander Gordon's
hand andthanked him forhisgreat service tothe
United States andtheworld. Each Cabinet officer and
army officer followed, andshook theSupreme Com-
mander's hand, wishing himcontinued success. The
President andGovernment officials were anxious for
Supreme Commander Gordon toexplain howhehad
accomplished thewonderful featofgoing around the

Lone Aviator," "Americans Savior."
