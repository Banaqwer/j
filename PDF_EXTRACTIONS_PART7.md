THE MYSTICISM OF NUMBERS 
 
  The philosophers of ancient Greece believed that numbers possessed some 
mysterious power independent of their arithmetical significance.  
  Thomas Taylor in his translation of Iamblicus’ Life of Pythagoras said: “ The Pythagoreans received from the theology of Orpheus the principles of intelligible and intellectual numbers; they assigned them an abundant progression, and extended their dominion.” 
  Hence that proverb was peculiar to the Pythagoreans that all things are assimilated to numbers. Pythagoras, therefore, in the Sacred Discourse clearly stated: ”Number is the ruler of forms and ideas, and is the cause of gods and demons.” 
  Numbers are used to express quantitative values in relation to Unity, which of itself is the first expression of Zero. From Zero all numbers proceed and into Zero they are all resolved again. Thus it comes about that the digits from first to last are represented by the number 10, the Alpha and Omega of all enumeration. If we set out the digits in their order we find that they present to us a very curious set of relation, thus: 
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 . 
 
   
bringing the first and last of these series together in order successively, we have— 
1 and 9 equals 10 
2 and 8 equals 10, 
3 and 7 equals 10, 
4 and 6 equals 10, 
leaving behind the characteristic number 5, which represents the human species with its five avenues of sensation, its five digits or fingers, its five peduncles or toes, and its five great Races. This number was held in great veneration by the ancients, and we find that among the Chinese and among the Hindus there is a tendency to count by fives. Thus the Chinese have the “Wu Hing” or five useful things were clay, wood, metal, fire and water. These were ruled by five planets. 
Saturn ruled earth or clay. 
Jupiter ruled wood. 
Venus ruled metal. 
Mars ruled fire. 
Mercury ruled water. 
So they called the names off the planets the Earth Star, the Wood Star, the Metal Star, and so on. The five precepts were filial love, loyalty, marital fidelity, obedience and sincerity, as regulating the relations between parents and their children, the rulers and

Hence that proverb was peculiar to the Pythagoreans that all things are assimilated

4the people, husbands and wives, masters and servants, man and friend. The five sorts 
of punishment were by fines, the rod, the scourge, banishment, and death. 
  Thus five may be said to stand for humanity and for human relations, man standings as it were in the middle ground of the manifest and unmanifest worlds, and in a measure cognising both the material and immaterial worlds by sense and thought, himself beings the embodiment of all, an epitome of the universe, a veritable microcosm. 
The total of the digits 1 to 9 is 45, or nine times 5. 
The total of the odd numbers is 25, or five times 5. 
The total of the even numbers is 20, or four times 5. 
  But each of the numbers comprised in the series has its traditional value as a symbol, and these symbols are associated with the Sun and members of solar system. 
  Note: This series is the astrological series or unit system which should not be confused with the Kabalistic series based on the Hebrew alphabet of twenty-two letters, which is described in Chapter 2. 
  In the Astrological series or unit system the symbol        
ONE 
is the symbol of the manifest Deity, who came forth from the Abyss of Nothingness, or Infinitude. It is the symbol of the Sun, the light that shone in the darkness of the world’s great night an became the source of all revelation, of heat and light, of wisdom and love, the vortex centre of the universe of worlds, the archetype. Hence it is symbolized as a circle with a point in the centre. 
Thus: Q. 
  It is the beginning; that by which all the rest of the nine numbers are created. The basis of all numbers is ONE; the basis of all life is ONE. This number represents all that is creative, individual and positive. It stands for force, boldness and activity as well as for powers of organizing and executive ability. 
TWO 
is the symbol of relativity, antithesis, witness, and confirmation. It denotes the binomial and “pairs of opposites,” as positive and negative, active and passive, male and female, light and dark, etc., in relation to Unity, which stands for the first named of these, two standing for the second of them. It represents the dualism of manifested life, as God and Nature, Spirit and Matter, Osiris and Isis, and their interrelation. It denotes the Law of Alternation in natural operations. It embodies the idea of procreation, fruition, combination, relationship of opposites, the two conditions: manifest and unmanifest; the explicit and implicit; buying and selling. It is 
symbolized by the Moon: 
R   .  
  The moon is related to two numbers, of which the number “2” gives the negative 
the people, husbands and wives, masters and servants, man and friend. The five sorts 
of punishment were by fines, the rod, the scourge, banishment, and death. 
Thus five may be said to stand for humanity and for human relations, man standings 
as it were in the middle ground of the manifest and unmanifest worlds, and in a 
measure cognising both the material and immaterial worlds by sense and thought, 
himself beings the embodiment of all, an epitome of the universe, a veritable 
microcosm. 
The total of the digits 1 to 9 is 45, or nine times 5. 
The total of the odd numbers is 25, or five times 5. 
The total of the even numbers is 20, or four times 5. 
But each of the numbers comprised in the series has its traditional value as a 
symbol, and these symbols are associated with the Sun and members of solar system.

5vibration. This can be understood as being the position when the Moon is conjunction 
with the sun, i.e. New Moon, and the Moon throwing no reflected light upon the earth. 
This number denotes relativity, vacillation and change. 
  The moon also stands for form and the growth of form and is the female counterpart of Number One, the two together creating the third number. 
THREE  
is the trilogy of life, Substance and Intelligence, applicable to Divine B EING; of Force, 
Matter, and Consciousness, applicable to natural E XISTENCE . Creation, preservation 
and resolution. Father, mother and child --- Osiris, Isis and Horus --- God, Nature and Man. The three dimensions of space. The three postulates --- thought, the thinker and the thing. The three parts of Time --- past, present and future. Thus it denotes in itself the idea of extension in both time and space, and stands for penetration, procedure and 
pervasion. It is symbolized by the planet Jupiter, a planet which plays a most important role both in astrology and in all systems of numerology. It is the beginning of what may be termed one of the main lines of force that runs right through all the numbers from one to nine. It has a special relation to every third number in the series such as three, six, nine. These numbers added together in any direction produce a nine as their final digit. 
                       3  +  6  +  9  =  1 8  =  9  
                       6  +  9  +  3  =  1 8  =  9  
                       9  +  3  +  6  =  1 8  =  9

  The number also stands for inclusion, comprehension, understanding, judgment; for increase, fecundity and propagation; thus and for self-expansion, the harvesting of the fruits of action, reward, equity, justice. Reproduction in the material world. Fatherhood, familism. By extension of self it becomes a symbol of sympathy, benevolence, charity, philanthropy, etc.’ and, by reflection, of joy, good fortune, and 
plenty. It is denoted by the planet Jupiter: 
V 
 
 
 
FOUR 
is the number of reality and concretion. Solids, the cube or square, the cross. Physical 
laws, logic, reason. Appearance, physiognomy, science, cognition. Segmentation, partition, order, classification. The Wheel of Fortune, the Wheel of Ixion, the Wheel of the Law, sequence, enumeration. The intellect which discerns between the 
vibration. This can be understood as being the position when the Moon is conjunction 
with the sun, i.e. New Moon, and the Moon throwing no reflected light upon the earth. 
This number denotes relativity, vacillation and change. 
The moon also stands for form and the growth of form and is the female counterpart

6noumenal and phenomenal, thought and percep tion. Discernment, discretion, relativity. 
It is symbolized by the Sun, Q , of which it is the negative number. Being a negative 
number it is, therefore, formative instead of creative as with the number One. It shows 
a sequence of organic changes. It is a number which is associated with alchemical 
processes involving sublimation and transmutation and all mutation of atomic structure, ancient or modern.  
  This is also the number of opposition, rebe llion and explosion and, in the latter, may 
be linked to the principle of chain reaction and thus links with the modern scientific trend of nuclear fission. 
 
FIVE 
is the number of variety, adaptability and mental change. It has rule over the outer consciousness which deals with the material factors of life and the process of discrimination, analysis, sometimes the tearing of things to pieces as on criticism. All forms of literary expression and the exercise of local government come under its 
vibration. It is symbolized by the planet Mercury : 
S . 
  In its constructive aspect it gives a wonderful elasticity of thought and inspiration 
which can be expressed in speech and writing thus making oratory and the written word key-notes of the numbers influence. From the less favorable angle the vibration brings a danger of active plagiarism. Vacillation and indicision are concomitant factors and if given way to will weaken the character and cause ultimate loss of prestige and reputation. The number is associated with quicksilver, the volatile qualities of which are well known, as it can split into a myriad particles in a moment of time and yet coalesce again just as quickly. 
  The number often express itself in a dual capacity, drawing out the potential for both good and evil, ranging from the highest intellectual attainment to the lowest degree of mental debasement. 
 
 
 
 
SIX 
is the number of co-operation, of marriage, interlacing, link or connection. It represents the two triads in their interaction, the Seal of Solomon* or interlaced triangles. The interplay of spirit and matter, the human soul; psychology, divination, communion, psychism, telepathy, spychometry, and alchemy. The Great Work. Co-ordination, concord, harmony, peace, satisfaction, happiness and material well being. Intercourse and reciprocity. Connubiality, the relations of the sexes.

  In certain instances the number Six is considered a rather weak number, and its 
weakness is intensified in terms of human character and destiny if more than one Six appears in the computation of the name-number or the number horoscope. Readers will recall references which have been made in biblical and other writings to the beastiality of the number 666 which is really three sixes and termed the number of the  “Beast”. When two or more sixes occur the principle of temptation becomes emphasized and exercises a malign influence over life and destiny.

It is symbolized by the Moon, 
R, of which it is the positive number. In this positive 
expression it is associated with the full Moon when the Moon is in exact opposition to the Sun and thus reflecting the full light of the Sun and thus reflecting the full light of the Sun onto the Earth. 
  Seven is the mystical number, the number which governs all rites and ceremonies of a magical nature which can only be performed correctly at the time of the full moon. The invoking of elemental forces and spirits, the performing of exorcism for the banishment of evil spirits, the overcoming of obsessions and the forcing of a discontinuance of poltergeist phenomena are all the more easily performed by using the number seven in the ritualistic preparation, particularly at the time of the full Moon. 
  This number is greatly associated with the domestic and family conditions of the life and has much to do with the function of  childbirth, which is the actual delivery of 
the infant and the commencement of a separate existence. 
EIGHT 
is the number of completion. Time and space, duration and distance, old ages, decadence and death. 
  There are many curious things in history as regards this number. The Greeks called it the number of Justice on account of its equal divisions of equally even numbers. The Jews practised circumcision on the eighth day after birth. At their Feast of Dedication they kept eight candles burning and their Feast lasted eight days. Eight 
prophets were descended from Rahab. There were eight sects of Pharisees. Noah was 
the eighth in direct descent from Adam. The strange number of three eights (8 8 8) is

8considered by certain students of occultism to be the number of Jesus Christ in His 
aspect as the redeemer of the world. This number 8 8 8 given to Christ is in direct opposition to 6 6 6 which the Book of Revelations states is “the number of the Beast 
or the number of Man”. It is symbolized by the planet Saturn: 
W. 
 
From the earliest ages it has been associated with the symbol of an irrevocable Fate 
both in the lives of individuals and with Nati ons. It may be pointed out that the planet 
Saturn is the ruling planet of the Jewish race, a race which has left the hand of Fate through the centuries. On the other hand, the number eight and the planet Saturn are both associated with destiny which is, in essence, the higher attribute of Fate, as it gives the individual the freedom of action which can be creative of either Destiny of Fate. 
 
NINE 
is the number of activity, energy, the fighter, the battle, the element of strife, and the expressing of courage. It shows a danger of  foolhardiness, of impulsiveness of word 
and action, of quarrels and strife, and of accidents, particularly from fire and 
explosion. Resourcefulness and capacity for organization whether it be applied to the exigencies of the battlefield or the vocational interests of life, are common assets of 
this number. It is symbolized by the planet Mars: 
U. 
 
  The number nine has some curious properties. In mathematics it is the only number 
that, multiplied by any other number, always reproduces itself. For example, 9 times seven is 63, and 6 plus 3 once again becomes 9. This is the case with every number 
that it is multiplied by . 
  It is also of interest to note that in ancient burial the deads were always buried on the ninth day. The Saviour died at the ninth hour. Both the first and second temples of the Jews were destroyed on the ninth day of the Jewish month called Ab. In comparatively recent times the planetary scale was advanced from seven to nine by the discovery (or re-discovery) of the planets Uranus and Neptune, the former being discovered in the 18
th century (9) and the latter in the next century, i.e. 1845 (9). 
   
 
There is again a mysterious association of the number 9 with number 6 6 6 for, if these three sixes are added together, 18 is obtained and 1 plus 8 gives the figure 9. This is really the spiritual number of 6 6 6

stands for Eternity, immensity, the infinite, infinitude, the universe in concept, Divine 
conception, ideation universality, circumambulation, navigation, circulation. Also for circumference, limitation, privation, restriction, and imperfection. Thus it is the universal paradox, the infinitely great and the infinitely small, Boundless Being and 
the Atom. Its symbol is the planet Pluto: 
[. 
 
  The cipher (0) is associated with the repetitive principle for, when it is added to 1, it 
becomes ten and when doubly added becomes 100, and so on. Thus it shows transformation and the long term plan of action. It can also signify negation. It has rule over atomic power or force and, from the standpoint of human character or destiny, it will rule the unknown or unseen factor which is often referred to as the “X” factor. 
  In the 20th century the planetary scale was stepped up to 10 by the discovery of the 
planet Pluto. It is interesting to note that both the planetary scale and the century involved have had the cipher “0” amplified. This planet has definite rule over the Atom and the “H” bomb, which have both been developed since the discovery of Pluto, and whose function of annihilation is one of the attributes of this planet. 
  These ascriptions follow the order of the days of the week and the Hebraic system of planetary numbers, thus:- 
  0 Space, Pluto; 1 and 4 the Sun (1 positive, 4 negative); 2 and 7 the Moon (2 negative, 7 positive); 3 Jupiter; 5 Mercury; 6 Venus; 8 Saturn; 9 Mars. 
  The corresponding days are: 1 and 4, Sunday; 2 and 7, Monday; 9, Tuesday; 5, Wednesday; 3, Thursday; 6, Friday; 8, Saturday. 
  The planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto do not come within the ordinary septenary 
scale as they commence the second octave of planetary vibrations. Uranus, however, being the octave of Mercury, will be associated in its positive aspect with Wednesday and the number 5, and in its negative aspect, with Sunday, number 4 and the Sun. The reason for this is that Uranus is the secondary ruler of the sign Aquarius, the opposition sign to Leo which is ruled by the Sun. In the case of Neptune, which is the octave of Venus, it will in its positive aspect be associated with Friday and the number 6, but in its negative aspect it interchanges with the Moon and thus will influence Monday and the number 2. Pluto is the octave expression of Mars and from its positive standpoint will influence Tuesday and the number 8; its negative side is the cipher 0.

10CHAPTER TWO 
 
THE HERBREW KABALA 
 
  In the previous chapter a description has been given of what may be termed the 
single or “unit” numbers from 1 to 9 and of the Cipher “0”, together with correspondences to the Sun, Moon and planets, and the days of the week.  
  There is, however, an extension of number allocation beyond the unit bringing in what may be termed double or composite numbers from 10to 22. This extension is associated with the Hebrew Kabala. The word Kabala means Traditional Knowledge. 
  In the Hebrew Alphabet there are 22 letters and these are linked with the numbers from 1 to 22, and with the letters of the English Alphabet. As the latter consists of 26 letters there are in certain instances a grouping of more than one English letter for the corresponding Hebrew letter.

CHAPTER TWO 
THE HERBREW KABALA 
In the previous chapter a description has been given of what may be termed the 
single or “unit” numbers from 1 to 9 and of the Cipher “0”, together with 
correspondences to the Sun, Moon and planets, and the days of the week. 
There is, however, an extension of number allocation beyond the unit bringing in 
what may be termed double or composite numbers from 10to 22. This extension is 
associated with the Hebrew Kabala. The word Kabala means Traditional Knowledge. 
In the Hebrew Alphabet there are 22 letters and these are linked with the numbers 
from | to 22, and with the letters of the English Alphabet. As the latter consists of 26 
letters there are in certain instances a grouping of more than one English letter for the 
corresponding Hebrew letter. The following Table shows the Hebrew letter, the 
Engl-ish Equivalent and the associated number together with the zodiacal or planetary 
ruler.

11With the number 10 as an integral number we come to the first of the double numbers 
and these each have a distinctive influence.  
 
  The number TEN in itself shows a transition from the units to the double numbers and therefore denotes a change and a manifesting of vibrations and conditions upon another and a different plane, of spirituality, of mentality or thought, and of physical action or material expression. Whereas the number ONE came under the influence of Mercury, the ruler of the brain and the mind, the number TEN comes under the influence of the planet Uranus which is the octave expression of Mercury and governs the twin factors of Inspiration and Genius. Mercury rules the literary processes of thought, Uranus rules thee scientific and, in its influence over the life and destiny of the individual, will bring sudden and unexpected changes of thought and action and of Fortune, sometimes for good and sometimes for ill, sometimes as a result of the volitional thought and action of the individual, at other times as a direct result of Fate, or circumstance. 
 
  The number ELEVEN operates through the higher emotional side of the nature, showing the expression of the universal compassion and love as distinct from the personal and selfish form of love which is often cased upon passion. It is a feminine and a magnetic number and has a great deal to do with psychic force as well as spiritual power and fortitude. It comes under the domination of the planet Neptune and gives the capacity to use the power of suggestion so as to influence other people and help them in the overcoming of physical , moral and spiritual weakness. 
 
  The number TWELVE is also an emotional number giving a superb understanding of the depths of human emotion and suffering. As a result of this understanding it gives the capacity to make sacrifices for others and to “turn the other cheek” when abused or ill treated. Despite all the vicissitudes of life there will be a warmness of expression towards other people and a maintaining of a sense of humour. Responding to the vibration of the zodiacal sign of Pisces it arouses the desire to heal the sick. It is the number of Nursing and of Administration. 
 
  The number HIRTEEN is another number of transformation, this time having rule over matters to do with both life and death and the transition from the earthly to the astral sphere of activity. It signifies the beginning of a new cycle where there is more freedom and where the thralldom of the material and financial cares of earthly life are absent. From another angle it is the number of bravery and of the pioneer, for it responds to the influence of the Zodiacal sign Aries. It draws out a natural degree of the kind of courage needed to handle the varying fluctuations in ordinary life and to face up to danger and even to death when they occur.

  The number FOURTEEN is more material and physical number. It has to do with 
Nature itself and with what may be termed the Forces of Nature. It is a conserving number and yet has extremely great potentiality of power when it is unleashed. To some extent it is associated with the factor of growth—the growth of living 
organisms—and with beauty, art, music and singing, whilst from a more material standpoint it will have influence over money and over precious stones in their entirety. 
The zodiacal sign of Taurus exercised its sway over this number, giving firmness, inertia or obstinacy and yet dynamic force that will not be frustrated. 
 
  The number FIFTEEN is the number of Fate and Destiny. It gives Power and yet can take it away. In some respects it is a number of mystery and of matters to do with the Underworld, of Purgatory or Hell, where the soul of the individual may languish as a result of evil things done whilst on earth. It warns that the exercise of authority should never be abused, for it is also a number associated with the principle of Justice. 
As one sows so must one reap. It is dominated by the planet Saturn. It shows that, if power is used wrongly, a fall from position must occur and a Karma is created for future earthly incarnation; but if power is used justly and wisely, then the principle of Predestination becomes operative. 
 
  The number SIXTEEN is another very powerful number, both for good and for ill. It governs the physical forces and passions, blind anger, rash impulse, temper, and yet, from the constructive standpoint, shows the capacity to be aggressive when there is the necessity to put up a fight against wrong-doing and the evil actions and brutality of others. It can bring a spirit of rivalry and, when this is permitted unduly, it can cause destruction; but when used to promote healthy competition for constructive ends, it will give tremendous force and energy. It is ruled by the planet Mars, the planet of war and pestilence but also the planet of exploration and discovery. 
 
  The number SEVENTEEN is another spiritual number and expresses the principle of Immortality, the continuity of ideas and of principles themselves. Some of these principles can be summarized as Truth, Hope, Faith, Charity, principles that persist through all ages and are to be found in all races and in all parts of the world. It is a number of illumination and aids in the understanding by the Zodiacal sign of Gemini, representative of intellectual force, of intuition and of reason. 
 
  The number EIGHTEEN is what may be termed a “difficult” number. It shows an attack by the materialistic side of the nature on the spiritual attributes. There is a danger of giving way to intrigue and deception on the one hand and of encountering false friends and secret foes on the other hand. It gives a warning of both treachery

13and danger, caused bitter quarrels which can involve friends and family and implies 
periods of danger through water, fires and even explosions. Astrologically it is influenced by the sign Cancer which, although giving a tenacity of purpose, can also bring a fear of the unknown. 
 
  The number NINETEEN on the other hand is one of the fortune numbers. It brings conditions of happiness and joy, and is especially helpful and favorable for all interests to do with children and young people. It is one of the creative numbers, physically, mentally and emotionally, and is significator of such love as springs unselfishly into manifestation as a result of  natural harmony and of joy of life. It will 
bring much progress, advancement and attainment, and as it is under the vibration of the Zodiacal sign of Leo with the pictorial symbol of the Sun, it is a number promising success, honour and esteem. 
 
  The number TWENTY is again a mainly favorable number, although its fortune depends to a great extent upon the Faith, and Effort, of the individual. It symbolizes Awakening or Resurrection, and from a spiritual standpoint shows that there must be a firm faith that there is an after life and a continuation of activity after the death of the physical body, if spiritual progress is to be made and inner understanding and illumination obtained. Similarly there must be faith in the individual ability to do things as well as a putting forth of personal effort in order to demonstrate that ability and thus bring about progress along that partic ular sphere of life which is if greatest 
interest. The Moon is the planetary ruler of this number and it governs the principle of gestation. 
 
  The number TWENTY-ONE is a number of advancement and of elevation. It shows the crowning factor of achievement as a re sult of effort—the obtaining of power, of 
authority, of recognition. It will bring victor y after a long fight. It symbolizes the one 
who is at the head of affairs irrespective of whether they are spiritual or material. It is 
the number of the Adept, the King, the President, the Head of the Clan, Cause or Home. It comes under the vibration of the Sun as the planetary ruler and shows a working out of Destiny in a positive manner. 
 
 
  The number TWENTY-TWO is an unfortunate number. It is the number that inspires doubt and unbelief and shows an individual who is in danger of letting his own conceit and vanity blind him to the spiritual, emotional and physical dangers that beset his path. It is a number warning against illusion and delusion, a number of false judgment and degeneration f its weakness, if so, then the liability to failure, folly or mistake can be overcome. It is under the rulership of the Earth and as such does 
and danger, caused bitter quarrels which can involve friends and family and implies 
periods of danger through water, fires and even explosions. Astrologically it is 
influenced by the sign Cancer which, although giving a tenacity of purpose, can also 
bring a fear of the unknown.

15CHAPTER THREE 
 
NAMES AND NUMBERS 
 
  In unlocking the meaning of a name, the numerical value of that name must be 
obtained by the adding together of the numbers that correspond to each letter of the name, finding the sum total and then either reducing this to a unit, i.e.  1 to 9, if the 
unit system of numbers is used, or reducing to number 22 or under should the Kabalistic system of numbers be used; for, as already explained, each of the 22 numbers associated with the Kabala has a specific influence. 
  Let us, therefore, take a few examples at first of Christian or Forenames—not surnames, as they describe family traits and family history rather than the personal or individual character and fortune. 
  A few popular names will serve to show the method involved and both the Unit and Hebrew Kabalistic system of numbers will be illustrated: 
     Unit System                            Kabala 
A   R   T   H   U   R                    A   R   T   H   U   R  
1   2    4   8    6   4                    1   2 0   2 2   8   6   2 0  
    =   2 5   =   7                           =   7 7   =   1 4  
 
  Here we see that the unit system of numbering brings in the influence of the number 7 whilst the Kabala brings in the influence of the number 14. With the Unit system the number 7 is ruled by the Moon (it is the positive number of this luminary) whereas in the Kabala the number 14 brings in the influence of the sign Taurus. If one wishes to take a composite or extremely broad view of the character then both descriptions could be taken and applied, the description of the Moon being found under the number 20 on page 28, and the description of Taurus and the number 14 being found on page 26 in chapter 4. 
  Further illustrations of names:- 
     Unit System                            Kabala  
E   D   W   A   R   D                   E   D   W   A   R   D  
5   4    6    1   2   4                    5   4    6    1   2 0   4  
=   2 2   =   4                           =   4 0   =   4  
 
  In this instance the final result of the number comes to the same, 4 in each case, and when this occurs it can be taken as a concentrating or consolidating of the particular vibration of that number on the character.

WHICH IS CONSTANTLY IN USE . There will be no lessening of the primary influence of

21CHAPTER FOUR 
 
NUMBERS AND CHARACTER 
 
  In-so-far as an individual is concerned, the effect that a specific number has upon 
his or her life can be demonstrated in terms of character, of health, of personal associations such as marriage, relatives, friends and enemies, of money, whether it be earned through work or business, or gained by speculation, investment, gift or legacy, of work or vocation itself, of travel, and of mental or artistic ability. 
  The zodiacal or planetary influence of each number from 1 to 22 will give a specific vibration and, in terms of character, these will be as shown in the following descriptions which have been written as applying to YOU to be the more easily explainable and understandable. 
  The preceding chapter explained how to find your own specific number from your name; thus you will be able to apply the specific character vibration of that number to yourself. In the same way you will be able to learn the characters of others. 
  The number ONE (planetary influence Mercury, S) rules the brain and the mind 
and hence will give good intellectual capacity. It will attract to pursuits and work of a mental rather than of a physical character and is associated with learning, education 
and the teaching or training of others, and gives capacity for the holding of executive and administrative positions. There is a combination of independence and yet of adaptability, a capacity to acquire a myriad of facts and yet be able to coagulate these into one fixed line of action should the latter be desired. Knowledge will be gained through observation and travel and considerable travel is denoted although much of this will be of a short or medium long distance nature rather than of a long distance or overseas character. There will be a capacity for writing and certain forms of literary work, for journalism and contact with newspapers and associated publications. 
  The number TWO (zodiacal influence the sign Virgo, F) gives you a natural power 
of discrimination and perception which will express itself in a natural manner through business and associated channels. You will be able to carry out the details of affairs without losing sight of the ultimate goal towards which you are working. You can carry out any routine set you by others and, when necessary, can evolve a routine of your own proving satisfactory to all concerned. It does not take you long to weigh up the pros and cons of affairs and your power of perception enables you to see beneath the surface to the truth that others may try to hide. You are appreciative of neatness and tidiness and prefer proper discipline to lackadaisical methods. The sign will cause you to be critical and you will need to use discretion in the expressing of criticism, for anything of a hurtful nature, even though it may be true, could be taken exception to by the ones concerned, and misunderstandings could arise. 
  The number THREE (zodiacal influence, the sign Libra, G) gives you a strong

22desire for peace and harmony and causes you to be sensitive to anything of a 
deliberately discordant nature. You are naturally courteous and desirous of being on good terms with other people, but you will always need to maintain a proper spirit of independence so as to prevent certain people from imposing upon you who are aware of your natural disinclination to enter into arguments or disputes. A tendency towards giving way to the line of least resistance will need to be faced up to and overcome. You will be attracted towards the social and public sides of life and should do all you can to further these interests. Do not let domestic matters or the attempted domination of those in your surroundings have a restrictive influence over you. You can be very adaptable but you can also be very easily upset by adverse criticism or temporary rebuffs, and inclined to take things more to heart than you should do. 
  The number FOUR (zodiacal influence, the sign Scorpio H) gives you a degree of 
reserve and in certain respects will cause you to be secretive, although this will not necessarily interfere with your everyday associations. It shows that you will display considerable resourcefulness in the handling of people and affairs and as a result will work through difficulties somewhat more easily than may be anticipated, either by yourself or others. 
  You will express more resistance and fighting capacity than those around you may recognize, and should anyone attempt to take an unfair advantage of you they will be extremely surprised at the resistance you will put forth in the protecting of your own interests. You have the courage of your own convictions to say and do the things you consider to be correct, will always try to push ahead with affairs in your own way and will not let others impose upon you or force you to do things against your own desires. 
  The number FIVE (planetary influence, Jupiter, V) will give you a broad and 
tolerant view upon life and will strengthen your spirit of comradeship. You will always be willing to help others in trouble but will need to maintain commonsense as there will be times when certain persons will seek to take an unfair advantage of your goodness of spirit. Religious and philosophical matters will appeal to you, there will be a strong desire for travel and it is possible for the missionary spirit to be strong. The spirit of optimism will invariably be marked but on occasions can cause you to experience loss when you permit yourself to take certain possibilities too much for granted or rely too much upon the element of luck or chance. The main essential to bear in mind is that whilst keeping optimistic you should also be practical. 
  The number SIX (planetary influence, Venus T) being ruled by the planet of 
affection, of love and of beauty, will cause your desire for companionship to be exceedingly strong and, therefore, all matters to do with the affections, with marriage 
and with friendships will prove to be very important and a great deal of your happiness or unhappiness in life will depend upon the nature of the ties and associations which you form. If these are of a constructive and helpful nature they 
desire for peace and harmony and causes you to be sensitive to anything of a 
deliberately discordant nature. You are naturally courteous and desirous of being on 
good terms with other people, but you will always need to maintain a proper spirit of

23will bring happiness and enable you to make considerable progress in life, but should 
they be of an impulsive and unwise character, then they will bring unhappiness, depression and an interference with your progress. There will be an appreciation of the artistic side of affairs even if circumstances prevent you from developing any form of art yourself. Sometimes the artistic faculty will find scope in painting, decoration, etc., even in the preparing of foods in a manner both appetizing and appealing to the sight as well as to the taste. 
  The number SEVEN (zodiacal influence, the sign Sagittarius U) causes you to be 
frank and outspoken with a very strong desire for liberty and freedom of thought and action, as well as for the maintaining of personal independence. Under normal circumstance you will usually adhere to the ordinary customs and conventions of life, but should affairs become too monotonous, or should there be any degree of what appears to you to be unfair restriction or limitation, a spirit of rebellion will occur and you will then say and do things and brings about changes without letting the immediate results affect you too strongly. 
  You are naturally active, energetic and optimistic but you will need to control impulsive and hasty inclinations whilst you should not give way unduly to restlessness. You are naturally self-reliant and you can inspire others by the example you set. An interest in sport is denoted. 
  The number EIGHT (zodiacal influence, the sign Capricorn J) causes you to be 
ambitious, practical and in some ways acquisitive. There will be a more or less natural gravitation towards the holding of positions of authority and trust, but you should not permit others to shift unfair burdens of responsibility onto your shoulders and then take the credit and benefits for themselves. It is a sign showing that you can work hard and long and will invariably set an example  to others that they will find it exceptionally difficult to emulate. 
  For this reason you will also experience difficulties when you want others to carry out work for you, as they will want others to carry out work for you, as they will never do things in quite the same way as yourself or take quite the same pains you do, nor will they exhibit a like degree of thoroughness. 
  Sometimes you will know what it is to feel depressed and unhappy, and will temporarily lose heart and wonder if there is anything in life worth working for. During these periods do not shun the company of others but take part in social affairs. 
 
  The number NINE (zodiacal influence, the sign Aquarius K) shows that you are 
thoughtful, reflective and studious. Many of your thoughts and ideas will be in advance of those of your companions and yet will not interfere with your friendships and associations, in fact you will find that those with whom you associate will often look to you for advice regarding their problems and you may need to use a degree of firmness to prevent imposition. Discretion will be required regarding the taking on of

they be of an impulsive and unwise character, then they will bring unhappiness, 
depression and an interference with your progress. There will be an appreciation of 
the artistic side of affairs even if circumstances prevent you from developing any 
form of art yourself. Sometimes the artistic faculty will find scope in painting, 
decoration, et

24obligations and liabilities, especially of a financial character, where friends and 
relatives are concerned. 
  From a general standpoint the sign cause you to be cheerful, sincere and optimistic, but in a quiet, rather than an ostentatious manner. You have some very strong likes and dislikes, and will be very firm where your principles, convictions and lines of action are concerned, and will put up a deal of resistance when others try to force you to do things or to agree to conditions that are against your own inclinations. 
  The number TEN (planetary influence, Uranus X) shows that somewhat erratic 
tendencies are denoted. Whilst there will be an undoubted brilliance of thought and inspiration, a capacity for making quick and constructive decisions in an emergency, and for carrying these decisions into action without loss of time, under ordinary circumstances when nothing of very great importance is manifesting, there will be a difficulty in exercising adaptability to such conditions and hence there will be a making of impulsive and unwise decisions regarding changes and in connection with prevailing associations. As a result sudden upsets and disputes will occur, there will be a disturbing of working or business interests and a danger of a loss of job or position, whilst personal ties and associations can be strained, sometimes to actual breaking point. In many respects you will be a “law unto yourself” and will go your own way irrespective of the desires or commands of others; in fact any attempt on the part of people to force you to follow their way will only make you go in the opposite direction. 
  The number ELEVEN (planetary influence, Neptune Y) will intensify your insight 
into affairs and enable you to gauge the outcome of a given line of action in an almost uncanny manner. It shows that you will be able, sometimes without hardly being aware of it, to influence other people by your mental and oral suggestions and in so doing will get them to react and do things that are in accord with your own desires. Discretion will, however, be required in the using of this power of suggestion, for otherwise, should you be tempted to influence other people to do things to suit a selfish end you could bring a tantalising and unpleasant future reaction. You will have much latent psychic ability, which you can express as a result of proper development, for the planet gives a capacity for chairvoyance, sometimes for trance mediumship, and also for psychometry. 
  The number TWELVE (zodiacal influence, the sign Pisces L) shows that you are 
idealistic and peaceably inclined. You can, however, be rather sensitive and there will be extremes of temperament and ability. Sometimes you will be extremely cheerful and optimistic and when you express this side of your nature, together with a degree of sympathy and understanding for others who are in trouble or difficulty, you will create considerable popularity and will make a great deal of progress. 
  On the other hand you can give way to extreme sensitiveness and allow yourself to feel hurt at the careless or thoughtless speech or actions of others and will try to cover 
obligations and liabilities, especially of a financial character, where friends and 
relatives are concerned. 
From a general standpoint the sign cause you to be cheerful, sincere and optimistic,

25this up by expressing an apparent air of indifference which will be rather puzzling to 
those around you, who will not be aware of having done anything to warrant being 
ignored. When you permit anything of this nature you will lose some of your popularity and certain of your friends, and misunderstandings will occur in a way you do not at all desire. 
  The number THIRTEEN (zodiacal influence, the sign Aries A) causes you to be 
independent, self-willed, active and desirous of being in command of affairs. You are courageous by nature and not likely to be afraid of facing danger when it arises, but you should not create conditions that bring it or that should not create conditions that bring it or that would lead to disturbing and unpleasant consequences. The combining of intellectual with physical activity will enable you to effect progress and to bring altered conditions in accord with your own desires. You can set an example to others that they will be pleased to follow when you combine tact with enthusiasm. If, however, you let aggressive inclinations, undue independence, or impulse, decide your line of action you can create unfriendliness, can lose support and hence interfere with your normal progress. 
  You will always want to fight against conditions of an unfair and restrictive nature. 
  The number FOURTEEN (zodiacal influence, the sign Taurus, B) causes you to be 
practical, industrious, and in many ways capable of exercising considerable patience where the more important interests of life are concerned. You have ability to plan out affairs ahead and to allow proper time for the maturing of your plans. You can also bring about a perfecting of the details relating to material and financial matters. Quite a number of your desires and wishes will be associated with money. You possess the courage of your own convictions and opposition from others will only tend to fix them more firmly in your mind. At the same time it would be wrong to term your disposition an unreasonable one, as you are prepared to consider the suggestions of others on their own merits, and if they appeal to you, adopt them. You will do so however, as and when you see fit. 
  The number FIFTEEN (planetary influence, Saturn W) in its influences over your 
character shows that you are serious, reflective, somewhat introspective and yet have the inner capacity to hold positions of responsibility and authority and to carry out duties efficiently. Life will not always bee easy for you. You will have to fight against restrictions, limitations and delays, but by the exercising of patience you will find yourself overcoming the varying difficulties that confront you, and as a result of persistence will bring about progress. Saturn rules the latter part of life and distinctly shows that this part of life will bring the re wards or disappointments of the efforts, or 
lack of effort, during the first half of life. It is a planet that attracts towards political and kindred affairs and gives very great organizing ability. It invariable denotes that a very advanced age will be reached and that time will be on your side in the making of plans and in the putting forth of effort, therefore you can afford to be painstaking and

those around you, who will not be aware of having done anything to warrant being

26will always be able to take the long rather than the short view of affairs. 
  The number SIXTEEN (planetary influence, Mars U) mainly signifies so far as your 
character is concerned, that you have courage. This will be of both a physical and a 
mental nature and no matter what the odds may be you will always face them and do your best to overcome your adversary, whether it be circumstances or a person. Nevertheless, it will not be easy to restrain impulse or to tone down quickness of temper and as a result of giving way to these you will experience many upsets and changes, and your emotional and home life will not always be happy. You are suited for adventure, for exploration, for taking part in anything that is active and that that keeps you on the move. When circumstance temporarily thrust you into a kind of quiet backwater you will rebel, sometimes violently and, figuratively speaking, will either do the disappearing trick yourself or be thrown out by others who resent their peace and quietness being disturbed. 
  The number SEVENTEEN (zodiacal influence, the sign Gemini C) indicates that 
you are active both physically and mentally. You will have a strong desire for variety and change but it will be unwise to allow this desire to get out of hand. An effort should always be made to maintain continuity of thought and action, and you should not alter objectives unless there is some very real and weighty reason for so doing. Otherwise you will find that you can interfere with the progress of affairs, can put forth a lot of effort and get very little in return. You should regulate the number of subjects you take up, for if you have too many things on hand at one time certain of them must perforce be neglected, particularly when circumstances compel attention upon those of greater importance. Hence valuable time, thought and effort will be sacrificed which has been devoted to those interests being given up. 
  The number EIGHTEEN (zodiacal influence, the sign Cancer D) signifies that there 
is a strong degree of emotion in your nature. You have a very vivid imagination and will be able to recall clearly and easily many of the events and conditions which have occurred in the past but should not allow yourself to dwell too much upon the past. You should utilize the knowledge gained from past experiences, to deal with and to regulate present affairs, and to plan out future activities. Matters to do with the home and family side of life will influence many of your decisions and actions, whilst there will be a great appreciation of domestic comfort and making others feel at home when they are in your surroundings. The sign gives you a very memory, much tenacity of thought and purpose and enables you to use your imagination so as to create publicity either for yourself or for others. 
  The number NINETEEN (zodiacal influence, the sign Leo E) gives you a great deal 
of natural ambition causing you to be desirous of making good headway and progress in life. There will always be a more or less automatic gravitation towards the occupying of a central position according to your best that you can, no matter what circumstances of life arise, and will invariably try to appear at your best when you are

27with others. You have a natural degree of pride and dignity and can express the 
principle of loyalty towards others and towards any cause you may espouse. There will, however, be times when you will need to control hasty and passionate impulses and inclinations, for should these be given way to, setbacks and downfalls can occur. Nevertheless, once you realize you have made a mistake or error of judgment you can take quick steps to bring about a retrieving of the situation. Your power of organization is good and will help you in the handling of business and private affairs. 
  The number TWENTY (planetary influence, the Moon R) in its rule over your 
character shows that there will be alternate periods of activity, enthusiasm and expression with others when you will feel you want to do nothing, when you will  lack incentive and when there will seem to be no inspiration. This ebb and flow of  feeling and action is quite in sympathy with the phases of the Moon, which show and upsurge of power and strength as it goes from the New to the Full and then a decrease of energy until apparent stagnation occurs as the Moon goes through the waning period from Full to New. Home, family and domestic interests will take a deal of your thought and attention, whilst this lunar influence is favourable for matters to do with the land, agriculture, dairy farming, etc. You will have a natural sympathy for others, and also for animals, especially when they are suffering, for what may be called the “mothering spirit” will always be strong. 
  The number TWENTY-ONE (planetary influence, the Sun Q) in its influence over 
the character draws out the sense of power and hence you will always have the desire to exercise authority and a degree of domination over others, and during the course of your life’s development you will do so. Nevertheless, when you are in a position of authority you will need to see that you use this in a constructive and proper manner, resisting any inclination to be autocratic or domineering. If the latter is given way to, not only will you make enemies, but you will interfere with the finer rewards which life can give you. You will be attracted to and have an interest in children and in education, art, theatrical and associated inte rests and be able to do quite a deal of good 
if you live up to the higher dictates of your na ture. The principle of leadership will be 
marked and if used constructively will bring recognition and possibly fame. 
  The number TWENTY-TWO (planetary influence, the Earth @) shows that the 
season of the year when you were born will have a determining influence over your character. If born in the Spring you will initiative, and the spirit of enterprise will be marked throughout the course of your life, but you will find yourself having to learn many lessons in your handling of affairs and in your association with other people before you acquire perception and discrimination. 
  If born in the Summer you will have organizing ability and the capacity to hold positions of authority. You will have a degree of pride and dignity and it will be relatively easy to obtain recognition of your abilities and the years from 40 to 60 will bring you to the zenith of your power.

  If born in the Winter you will have the wisdom of the ages. Many times you will be lonely because others will not reach up to your standard of thought and comprehension. The first half of life will be hard, but the second half can bring a realizing of earlier ambitions and desires.

29CHAPTER FIVE 
 
YOUR LOVE AND MARRIAGE NUMBER 
 
  In all the interests of life those to do with love and marriage are by far the most 
important, ranking equal to health on the one hand and to money on the other. The desire for companionship and affection is invariably exceedingly strong in the human make-up and much of the happiness or unhappiness in life will spring from the making of either a satisfactory attachment, leading to a successful marriage, or to the forming of an unwise association leading to emotional upsets and a possible frustration of marriage or to the bringing about of an unsuitable marriage with subsequent divorce. 
  When we know our own love and marriage number we become aware of our own prospects and this knowledge, if used correctly, can aid us in mitigating or even offsetting the unfavourable possibilities and of assisting those of a constructive and helpful nature. 
  By knowing the love and marriage number and its attributes of the prospective or actual partner, we are enabled in the former instance to see whether the mutual vibrations are helpful or the reverse and if necessary to make a decision; whilst in the latter instance, by knowing the potentialities of the marriage partner’s love and marriage number, we are enabled, if we so choose, to act so that there is mitigating of adverse significations, thus helping in the creating of greater harmony and hence of greater love and compassion, or, if the combination is harmonious, to bring about a realising of mutual desires and wishes where children, social and public interests, and other matters of importance are concerned. 
  To know our love and marriage number it is necessary to take ALL our Christian or Forenames and to obtain the totals of the numbers from both the systems, the Unit system and the Kabala—the former system being used to find the harmonies and antipathies between numbers, and the latter system giving the description of love and marital possibilities according to the planetary or zodiacal influence that corresponds to the number.  
  Of course, if one only has one Christian or Forename then the ultimate number derived from the addition of all the numbers of the letters of that name, as shows in chapter Three, will apply. Thus, in the case of the name EDWARD (see page xx), the total of which is 4 in each system, the 4 of the Unit system applied to the Table showing harmonies, antipathies, etc., on page 60,signifies that 4 vibrates to and harmonies with 6, attracts those whose number is 1 or 8, disagrees with or is antipathetic to those whose number is 3 or 5, and is passive to the charms, virtues or vices of those whose number is 2, 7 or 9.

30When there are two or more Christian or Forenames, then each name must be taken 
separately, and the total of each added together so as to obtain a second Unit and Kabala total. This is performed as follows:

                        4   +   1   =   5  
  The number 5 therefore becomes the love and marriage number, and the numbers that harmonize, disagree with it, or are neutral, are found in the Table of Harmonies and Antipathies, page 32.

  The number 14 being the number shown according to the Kabala, the indications regarding love and marriage are influenced by the sign Taurus.

  As the sum of the two name totals comes to over 22, i.e. to 25, it must be further reduced by the addition of the units so as to bring to 22 or under. In this instance it reduces to 7 and this will be the love and marriage number according to the Kabala.

32Explaining the above: 
(a) A number that vibrates to another shows that there is considerable mutual 
attraction and the marriage will be very favourable. 
(b) A number that attracts another shows that the two people are well suited to each 
other. 
(c) A number that disagrees with another shows that the union will call for a great deal 
of diplomacy, if it is to be attended with any measure of success. 
(d) Where a number is passive, it merely means that numerology offers no opinion, 
there being no outstanding influence for good or bad. 
(e) Of course, if the two numbers are alike, it is a foregone conclusion that the union 
will be very favourable.  
 
  The following attributes of the Love and Marriage number are based upon the 
planetary and zodiacal influences associated with each number. 
  The number ONE shows that the desire for variety in love affairs will be marked and hence it will not be too easy to bring about a lasting attachment which will be productive of marriage. You will be attracted towards intellectual types and yet, because of the intellectual bias, there can be an absence of passional warmth which, despite your own intellectual conception of affairs, you will desire. Hence it will be somewhat difficult to bring about desired developments. The marriage partner can be contacted whilst on a journey or as a result of attending a lecture or discussion group. Sometimes under the Mercury vibration the partner is a cousin. Once marriage has been brought about there will be need for exercising a degree of forethought and discrimination in order to ensure that the marriage shall last for, with an absence of passional warmth, misunderstandings could lead to a degree of bitterness and even to separation. 
  The number Two shows that you will use quite  a deal of discrimination in matters to 
do with the affectional and marital sides of life. There will be an attraction towards marriage and a desire for certain of the amenities and comforts normally associated with the marital side of life. Affectional and marital disturbances can, however, occur 
as a result either of the criticism of the pr ospective or actual partner or because of 
criticism of the prospective or actual partner or because of criticism or interference of 
others who play some part in your normal everyday life. If these conditions become too pronounced, then troubles and difficulties can be overcome. The best type of partner is shown to be someone who is intellectual but who can also give thought to what may be termed “creature comforts” and who will be practical so far as financial and kindred matters are concerned. 
  The number THERE shows that your desire for companionship and affection is strong and hence showing that there will be a natural attraction towards the marital side of life. You will entertain somewhat idealistic views regarding marriage, but

33should always maintain a degree of practicality as otherwise there can be either a 
difficulty in bringing about developments or in maintaining ties once they are formed. It is a sign as well that will seem to give a peculiar attraction towards certain types of person, of the opposite sex, and hence it will again be necessary to see that this sense of fascination does not cause you to form attachments again interfering with prevailing ties or causing complications not altogether anticipated or desired. On the other hand, if you let your knowledge of human nature guide you, you can make a good choice of partner and will find that that partner will aid you regarding any interests of a social, public or kindred nature in which you may take part. 
  The number FOUR shows that the affectional and emotional desires are very strong and hence will attract you towards marriage, but you will need to use some discretion in your making of attachments and in your choice of marriage partner as you will find that difficulties will be encountered through the jealously and antagonism of certain individuals and it will not be too easy to bring about desired developments. Personal impulses will require regulating and you should not always take the advances of others too literally nor link them up with the possibility of marriage. The correct type of partner is shown to be of an active temperament with quite a deal of physical courage, interested quite possibly in occult affairs and conceivably with certain mechanical interests as well. Resourcefulness will be a marked characteristic but they can be somewhat possessive and jealous, and because of this, emotional upsets and unpleasantness can occur. 
  The number FIVE shows that love affairs and marriage will be productive of quite a degree of happiness and of benefit. There will be a strong desire for affection, but the factor of sincerity will count for a lot and despite a natural desire for companionship previous to marriage, the commonsense view of affairs will keep this desire within bounds and thus give a better opportunity for a constructive association to develop to the point of engagement and later of marriage. In some respects interests of a philosophical and religious nature will play their part and the marriage partner can be met whilst attending church or a religious ceremony or through  activities connected with the religious side if affairs. Marriage is shown to be very helpful. There will be love and sympathy from the marriage partner and benefit through the help of the partner in connection with vocational and financial matters. 
  The number SIX shows that companionship being the keynote of this number’s influence, there will be a natural attraction towards certain members of the opposite sex and the desire for love and affection will be very strong. There will, however, be a need to control sudden impulses for, otherwise, attachments of an unsatisfactory nature will be formed and, should these be allowed to bring about marriage, the outcome would not be as happy or successful as anticipated. Yet if the difference between fascination and true love can be distinguished, real happiness, both before and after marriage, is signified. This number, however, is essentially a weak number 
should always maintain a degree of practicality as otherwise there can be either a 
difficulty in bringing about developments or in maintaining ties once they are formed. 
It is a sign as well that will seem to

34and shows that emotional and sexual temptations will occur and if circumstances 
bring a compulsory period or periods of separation from the marriage partner after marriage, the desire for companionship can cause the forming of temporary associations which, if permitted to go too far, could lead to a disturbing of the marriage tie. 
  The number SEVEN signifies that there will be more than one affectional attachment or love affair and it sometimes shows the consummation of more than one marriage. It indicates that interests to do with sport, outdoor life, animals and birds, travel and to some extent religion can be the means of meeting the prospective and actual partner. Although in its general influence the sign exercise a favourable vibration it does show that before the real partner is contacted and marriage consummated, there will be a making and breaking of associations and it is possible for one of these breaks to be caused by the prospective partner going away, either through travel or in connection with vocation, and failing to make a renewal of the contact. One thing is shown to be of great importance, and that is that after marriage any difference of race or religion should not be permitted to cause misunderstanding. 
  The number EIGHT shows that certain of your ambitions are associated with the affectional and marital side if affairs and that as a result of marriage you will aim to bring about a developing of business, social and public affairs with the co-operation of the partner. At the same time it may not be too easy to find the right type of partner and hence delays and obstructive conditions can arise, both in the actual forming of attachments and as regards the consummation of marriage. It is possible for the marriage partner to be older than yourself and for marriage to take place somewhat later in life than is usually considered to be the average age for marriage. You will need to give some of the pressure of everyday affairs is taken away. You will also find that at times the partner will not be too demonstrative from the affectional standpoint but this will not affect from their sincerity of affection. 
  The number NINE in its rule over love affairs and marriage shows that many of your hopes and wishes will be associated with these interests of life and you will want to bring about a developing of associations is that marriage can be consummated. As a result of marriage you will also find it easier to bring about a realising of other hopes and wishes to do with the social and public sides of life and with finance and business, as the help of the marriage partner will prove to be invaluable in these respects. Yet difficulties will be encountered in first of all making an attachment that can be developed up to the requisite end of marriage. In early life the sign shows an attraction to persons of the opposite sex who are older than yourself and some discrimination will be required to see that the disparity in age is not too pronounced, as this could bring future unhappiness. If marriage is not consummated reasonably early in life then, as age advances you will find that the attraction will veer round to those of the opposite sex who are younger, but a degree of prejudice can occur from 
and shows that emotional and sexual temptations will occur and if circumstances 
bring a compulsory period or periods of separation from the marriage partner after 
marriage, the desire for companionship can cause the forming of t

35others associated with the desired partner. 
  The number TEN being the number of a romance shows that there will be quite a 
number of love affairs in the life and some of these can be of quite a hectic and outstanding nature, but as the number also causes sudden upsets and breaks, the pathway of love will not run too smoothly and hence several affairs are signified before marriage is finally brought about. When it does take place it is likely to be in a sudden and unexpected manner and even after it has been achieved there will be a danger of sudden upsets if these are permitted to go to an extreme, separation or even divorce can occur. Therefore, you will need to be watchful as it will be so easy for things to go awry. Particularly as, owing to the romantic tendency in you nature, you can be attracted to two or even more persons of the opposite sex at the same time. 
  The number ELEVEN in its influence over love affairs and the condition of marriage, will be somewhat peculiar. It tends to bring about a forming of platonic associations, both before and after marriage, or circumstances can seem to compel a degree of secrecy. you will also find that your own power of mental and oral suggestion will have an influence over those towards whom you are attracted and hence, unless you are morally strong, can cause you to be tempted to do things to gain a selfish end. In giving way to such temptations, however, future trouble and unrest can be built up. Alternatively, there will be occasions when you yourself will be receptive to the suggestions of others and hence can experience some form of deception from the one to whom you are attracted or even married. The outcome of marital affairs will depend very greatly upon the trend of financial and business interests. If these go awry then the marriage can suffer. 
  The number TWELVE gives an idealistic conception of affectional and marital conditions and shows that you have the capacity to make many sacrifices in order to bring about a developing of affectional issues; it signifies that you will experience many vicissitudes and the trend of affectional matters will not run as smoothly or happily as you desire, and your spirit of sacrifice can in certain instances be abused in a very unfair manner by those to whom you give love unfair manner by those to whom you give love and affection. There is a strong indication of more than one affectional attachment, but breaks can occur either through the unwise or even selfish actions of the prospective or actual partner, or because of your disagreement with the partner’s mode of life or activities and a sudden realising that temperamental differences would only be productive of unhappiness. You need a partner who will be able to blend practicality with a degree of ambition and yet who will give some thought to domestic and private affairs, but the danger is that those whom you contact will not seem to have the necessary incentive to bring about progress desired, or, if they have, they will be already married or tied in some way. 
  The number THIRTEEN shows that you are somewhat idealistic regarding matters to do with  the affections and marriage, but may not always be practical. Certain 
others associated with the desired partner.

36types of the opposite sex will seem to have a rather peculiar attraction or fascination 
for you and if you do not exercise proper control you can give way to inclinations to form attachments interfering with existing ties. A degree of emotional impulse is strongly shown and is intensified by your natural desire for companionship. Affectional and marital interests will not always run too smoothly as the prospective or actual partner will usually be active and energetic and on occasions this activity will conflict with your own desire to pursue affairs in a reasonably quiet and unhurried manner, any attempt at domination on the side of the partner will be productive of friction and temperamental upsets. 
  The number FOURTEEN will enhance the desire for affection, but also gives a sense of discrimination and hence attachments will not be too lightly entered into. It is not a flirtatious number, but shows an appreci ation of sincerity and can give sincerity 
in return, therefore once an association is made there will be an intent to make it permanent and, if possible, to bring about marriage. Should a break occur, either though circumstances or because the prospective partner lacks the same sincerity as yourself, you will suffer rather severely and it will take quite a considerable time to overcome the sense of hurt and to take steps towards the forming of another attachment. Usually, with marriage has developed from a love match, as is quite possible, then there is not likely to be desire for a second marriage should the marriage partner die first. 
  The number FIFTEEN will exercise a retarding and delaying influence. In love affairs there will be a difficulty in making a requisite approach to someone of the opposite sex, and though the desire and the liking may be strong it will not be easy to express the desire in words or action and hence opportunities for the forming of attachments can be lost, particularly in early life. As age advances it will be easier to make the approach as result of past experience and a satisfactory attachment and marriage can be brought about, the latter being of a lasting nature. You are not likely to experience passionate flirtations and love affairs, for despite an inner ardency you will not be likely to attract those who would respond, but on the other hand you can bring about a marriage with a partner who will be constant and who will be more likely to stick to you through times of difficulty. 
  The number SIXTEEN invariably gives an ardency of affection and, therefor, more than one love affair or attachment is signified, there will be a tendency to rush into associations and sometimes to mistake fascination for love. On occasions an inclination to flirt, just for the fun of the thing, will be very strong, and so long as this does not go beyond certain limits no harm will result, but should the passional side of the nature be allowed to become too marked, future complications could occur. Once a definite attachment has been formed and engagement brought about you should not let temporary inclinations of an amorous natu re intervene as to permit this would be to 
bring about a possible upsetting of the association and engagement. The dame 
types of the opposite sex will seem to have a rather peculiar attraction or fascination 
for you and if you do not exercise proper control you can give way to inclinations to 
form attachments interfering with existing ties. A degree of emotional impulse is

37remarks will apply, and in an even stronger manner, after marriage, which, form a 
general standpoint, is shown to take place early in life. 
  The number SEVENTEEN shows that more than one affectional attachment will occur and there is a strong indication of more than one marriage. You will, however, need to exercise discretion in the making of attachments as, owing to your desire for change and variety, you can permit sudden fascinations to influence you and hence can make attachments which, after a time, pall and are creative of complications which will not be too easily overcome, especially should you wish to effect a breaking of the attachment. The correct type of partner is shown to be one of an intellectual disposition, a fairly good conversationalist and able to blend interests of a social and public nature with those of a domestic and family character. It is quite possible that the partner will be met whilst you are travelling or as a result of a journey and can be associated with intellectual, educational, newspaper or transport interests. 
  The number EIGHTEEN shows that as you have a strong desire for domestic comforts there will be a more or less natural attraction towards the condition of marriage and you will be able to do many things yourself towards making marriage a success. At the same time a great deal is shown to depend upon the attitude and activities of the partner and there is a possibility of temperamental upsets occurring because the partner either does not, or in cer tain respects will not, work in with certain 
of your ambitions, or put forward the same effort as yourself in order to bring about an advancing of material, business, social or public interests. At the same time the partner is shown to have a rather powerful imagination and will be productive of mutual benefit. There will, however, be times when the health of the partner will require attention. 
  The number NINETEEN shows that you will have a strong desire for affection, but signifies that certain of your ambitions can be  associated with or influenced by marital 
conditions and the business, financial and social position of the prospective or actual partner. There will, however, be need for discretion in your choice of partner as an unwise choice could be productive of considerable unhappiness and disappointment. Particular thought should be, in fact, given to the business or social standing of the partner, and it would not be advisable to marry anyone in a lower or mediocre social position as there would be an unfavourable reaction both upon future activities and personal happiness. Finance will also play some part in affairs, and in certain respects can sway your decision regarding the partner. Interests to do with children will have some influence over your decisions. 
  The number TWENTY in its vibration over marriage shows a strong desire for a home and, therefore, you will want to bring about an attachment that will not last too long before marriage take place. Hence your best type of partner will naturally be someone who will feel happy in doing cooking a nd the other domestic features of life, 
or will be willing to assist in the domestic side. Such a partner will help to bring about 
remarks will apply, and in an even stronger manner, after marriage, which, form a 
general standpoint, is shown to take place early in life. 
The number SEVENTEEN shows that more than one affectional attachment will 
occur and there is a strong indicati

38a successful marriage. In love affairs before marriage you will find yourself attracted 
towards the so-called “glamorous types,” but as a partner for life this type would not prove suitable for a lasting marriage. After marriage family life is shown to be important, and the reaction of the partner towards the question of children will make or mar the subsequent development of the marriage. 
  The number TWENTY-ONE, although in many respects a favourable number in its vibration upon love and marriage, follows a kind of two-way path. It intensifies the personal desire for love and affection and will bring the forming of very definite but tense associations. It shows, however, that the individual position in life will have a very strong influence over the actual trend of the love affair and over marriage itself, whilst the position of the prospective or actual partner will also be of very great importance, so much so that it is possible for factors beyond one’s own personal control to intervene, even to the extent of denying marriage. You will, therefore, need to take many things into account where love affairs are concerned, and it is possible for a great love to be experienced, and yet also a great sorrow. If marriage is brought about with the love one, then be prepared to make great sacrifices. 
  The number TWENTY-TWO is one that will give you quite a board-mined outlook upon life and consequently upon matters to do with love and marriage. Whilst you will have a natural desire for the companionship of and association with the opposite sex, you will try to view things from a practical standpoint and to maintain a practical line of action and hence, if a love affair peters out, as it is quite likely to do, you will try to accept the fact philosophically, even though you will naturally feel hurt. The philosophical acceptance will, however, help to overcome the sting and enable you to bring about another attachment. The number is mainly favourable for marriage and shows that the practical handling of the marital finances and on the social and kindred interests in which there is a joint operation with the marriage partner.

YOUR LUCKY AND MONEY NUMBERS 
 
In determining your lucky and money numbers a double sequence of factors has to be 
employed, for the lucky number can be quite distinct from the number that has rule over the general money indication of your life; but by knowing your lucky number, financial activities can often be arranged in the hour on any particular day that corresponds to your lucky number and this greater benefit can be derived then would ordinarily be possible. 
   To find your lucky number you must know the DAY OF THE WEEK on which you were born, whether Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and so on and the hour of that day on which you were born. The exact minute of the hour does not matter so much. If, for instance, you were born at 6.17 a.m. or p.m. then the hour would count from 6am or p.m. and so on with other times.  
   If you were born inn 1916 or any year subsequent to that date, and in a part of the world where Single Summer Time or Double Summer Time has been operative, do not forget to allow for the one hour or two hours difference in time. If you were born at say 4.30 a.m. when Single Summer Time was in force, then you correct time of birth would be one hour earlier, i.e. 3.30 a.m. and your lucky number would be that number which influenced the hour from 3 to 4a.m. If you were born when Double Summer Time was in force, say at 8.20 p.m., then your correct time of birth would be two hours earlier, i.e. At 6.20 p.m. and the number that influences the hour from 6 to 7 p.m. would bee your lucky number. 
      In the table given on page 78 the hours of each day, from Sunday to Saturday, a.m. and p.m. are given, together with the number that rules the hour. The number shown for your day and hour of birth will be your Lucky Number. 
     It will be seen that some of the number are in bold type and others in ordinary type. Those in bold type show the positive hours and those in ordinary type show the negative hours. Naturally, the positive hours strengthen the fortunate vibration and will bring proportionately a great degree of luck than the negative hours, but whichever hour you are born in, positive or negative, the number ruling that hour will be your lucky number. 
 
     Once having ascertained your lucky number from the day and hour chart it becomes relatively easy to begin to use its influence for, from the chart, can be seen the hours on the various days of the week when this number is exercising power.

   The positive hour or hours would, naturally, be best for anything of an active or constructional nature, but the negative hour or hours ruled by your lucky number would be extremely favorable for studies, re search, investigation, etc., and could be 
used for the filling in of a football coupon or for concentration upon the result of a horse or dog race, for during these negative hours, the power of inspiration would be considerably stronger than during the positive hours which, as stated, are more for active interests. 
To know one’s money number, which is completely distinct from one’s Lucky 
Number, we again have to revert to the numerical value of one’s name, and in this case the WHOLE of the name, inclusive of Christian or Forenames WITH Surname, must be taken into account. The numbers for each name should be set out separately, then the total of each name added and the final result reduced to 22, or under should it be above 22. The system of the Kabala is used for this and not the Unit system. Once the final number has been obtained, the planetary or zodiacal vibration associated with the number will give the overall indication regarding the general financial fortunes off life.

considerably stronger than during the positive hours which, as stated, are more for 
active interests. 
To know one’s money number, which is completely distinct from one’s Lucky 
Number, we again have to revert to the numerical value of one’s name, and in this

The number ONE in its influence over your money interests shows that money 
will be earned and derived from quite a variety of sources. Some of these can be of an intellectual and mental nature and others can be connected with travel, transport and certain mechanical affairs, for the influence gives quite a degree of adaptability and it will not take you long to see the possibilities latent in any given condition, to acquire a sufficiency of knowledge to handle it and then to turn it to practical use. Yet you will need to see that you do not fritter away any gain that occurs, or any reserve that you create during the progressive periods, by certain forms of irresponsible or thoughtless expenditure. Particular care will always be required in the making of financial agreements and arrangements and in the signing  of financial papers. Never take things to much for granted. 
 The number TWO causes you to have a strong sense of thrift without 
necessarily being mean. You will not mind spending money, within reason, but you will always do your utmost to obtain full value for the money you do spend. You will invariably do your best to regulate both income and expenditure and this will apply to

42private as well as to business activities. You will benefit through constructive 
developments to do with either work or business and through proper attention to details, but there will be occasions when it will be wiser not to express undue criticism of the decisions or actions of others who may be associated with your financial interests, for this would only tend to create misunderstanding and unpleasantness and could disturb co-operation or any form of partnership. Additional income could be obtained by using literary ability (if you do not already use this professionally) and by obtaining a knowledge of such things as accountancy, costing, etc., and using this knowledge inn a part-tim e capacity. Sometimes interests to do with 
food analysis and research and methods of distribution can be made to step up normal income. 
The number THREE signifies, in a rather peculiar manner, that you will either 
gravitate more or less automatically towards interests connected with the financial side of life or they will be drawn to you without any necessarily voluntary action on your part. In either event the use that you make of the opportunities brought by this contact will decide the degree of financial benefit that you ultimately derive. You will have a strong desire for the luxuries and amenities of life but will want money to come easily and without undue personal effort. If this tendency is given way to there will be a danger of yielding to temptations that come into your life and that are brought either by circumstances or by unscrupulous individuals who make suggestions that whilst being attractive are not strictly honest, and if given way to could involve you in transactions of a fraudulent character. Your main weakness will be a reliance upon others, but though this can aid you in obtaining money it will not bring permanent security unless you have a partner or someone to co-operate with who is strictly honest and straightforward. 
The number FOUR shows you have the ability to work hard and long in 
obtaining money, and with effort you can command quite a good income irrespective of whether you work for yourself or for others. At the same time you will always need to watch expenditure for you will always have an urge to spend money, and unless this is properly controlled you will find yourself taking up obligations and liabilities that will now always be easily redeemed but can be productive of temporary embarrassment. You are not necessarily personally extravagant, but it will be extremely difficult to refrain from spending money on equipment and machinery, especially if you work for yourself, in order to bring about greater efficiency. You will also want certain of amenities that help to make domestic life more agreeable, but in obtaining these will once again need to use discrimination so as not to overload yourself with payments out. In speculation, forethought will be required and undue risks should not be taken, but you will have quite shrewd judgement respecting investments.

The number FIVE is an exceptionally fortunate number to have as ruler over 
your financial affairs and shows that you will derive many financial benefits during 
the course of your life and will experience quite a deal of financial luck and good fortune. Benefit will come through your work and vocational interests, through speculation and investment and quite possibly through legacy or inheritance as well. At the same time there will be occasions when  extravagant inclinations will need to be 
resisted and when unwise risks to do with speculation or investment should be avoided, for should these inclinations be given way to then temporary periods of loss and of financial embarrassment can occur. A great deal will, therefore, depend upon your own handling of affairs. A commonsense approach to all financial matters will ensure progress and a building up of a very substantial reserve, but a taking of affairs too much for granted can interfere with progress and, as stated, bring losses. 
The number SIX exercises quite a helpful influence over money interests. It 
creates a vibration of attraction whereby money will come to you, sometimes with but little effort on your part. Although this does not imply that you should take things too easily and expect circumstances or luck to bring you everything you desire because if you do you can be sadly mistaken. If, however, proper personal effort is put forth then the fortunate vibration inherent in this planet will help to bring many benefits, both through work and business and from time to time through speculation and investment. You will also gain through the co-operation of others and through constructive partnership and marriage, providing in the latter instance that a wise choice of partner has been made. On the other hand, should an unwise choice of marriage or business partner have occurred then the danger of loss will be intensified. 
The number SEVEN signifies that from a general standpoint money matters will 
be reasonably progressive and there will be periods of luck and good fortune. Money and income can be desired through a blending of a variety of activities and by combining your main vocational interests with others of a secondary character. 
Fluctuations will occur both of income and expenditure and in the latter direction  
you will need to exercise a degree of commonsense and not rely unduly upon the factor of good luck, for though there will be fortunate periods, you can also experience losses and setbacks through taking certain things too much for granted. On occasions you will benefit through speculation and, in fact, there can be some attraction towards the taking of a risk in the hope of obtaining a substantial gain. You will, however, need to see that this attraction does not become too strong foe sometimes your “hunches” will be wrong, and if you take unwise risks then the resulting loss can cause you considerable stain and anxiety and interfere with your progress in other directions of a vocational nature. 
 
The number EIGHT shows that the factors of ambition will be very marked in

44your life where money is concerned. You will want money both from  the standpoint of 
the security it can give when you have built up a good reserve, as you will invariably 
do your best to do, and as a means to buy yourself as many of the things you desire, irrespective of whether these are of a domestic or a business nature, or both. 
You will always try to regulate expenditure, and on occasions may need to fight 
against a sense of undue caution which, if allowed to go to an extreme, could stop you from spending money even when it is necessary for you to do so. From a normal standpoint, however, it will be the practical side of your nature which will regulate your activities, showing that you can be careful and yet not necessarily deny yourself of wither the necessities or of some of the luxuries of life. You will gain through a 
developing of business activities and by holding of responsibilities which link the business and financial sides of life with those of a social, public and political nature, and where you can use your power of organisation. 
The number Nine indicates that many of your personal hopes and wishes will be 
associated with money and with the financia l side of life. Alternatively, the obtaining 
of money and a good income will enable you to bring about a realising of other hopes and wishes connected with the social and public sides of life and with affectional and friendly matters. 
Normally, the sign will give much forethought and a deal of practicality in the 
handling of financial affairs and will strengthen your sense of responsibility in that direction. You will be likely at times during your life to hold positions of trust where other people’s money is involved, but should always never becomes mixed with your own for this could be productive of future upset, misunderstanding and even of loss. You will benefit more as a result of constructive investment then by the taking of speculative risks, for your judgment on the former will be far better than with the latter. 
The number TEN signifies that you will have sudden gains and sudden losses, 
some of which will be cause through unexpected alternation of your vocational activities and others through speculation of the taking of risks. If, however, you let your originality of thought and action aid you, you can derive more gain than loss, particularly if you do you your best to plan out affairs ahead and to take proper account of the possible risks and snags that can occur. You will need to watch matters to do with the affections or any form of business partnership or co-operation, for any sudden upset or misunderstanding will react adversely and bring a danger of loss. A maintaining of co-operation will be essential. The number does show a great possibility of gain through such things as sweepstakes, lotteries and football pools. 
The number ELEVEN exerts a rather peculiar influence. It gives you the ability 
to take the long view of affairs, to correctly appraise future possibilities and to use your power of suggestion to influence other people with whom you have financial dealings so that they come round to your line of thought and action and are willing to 
your life where money is concerned. You will want money both from the standpoint of 
the security it can give when you have built up a good reserve, as you will invariably 
do your best to do, and as a means to buy yourself as many of the things you desire,

45assist and help you. On the other hand you will always need to guard against trouble 
or loss through the deception or trickery of others, and at times through dishonesty, actual theft or burglary. There will be occasions when, as a result of encountering difficulties, you will be tempted to do thins to overcome the difficulties, that at more normal times would not be contemplated.  There temptations should be resisted.  
The number TWELEVE indicates that, although there will be an experiencing of 
fluctuations in connection with money matters, from both the income and expenditure standpoints, there will be periods of luck and good fortune as well as a safeguarding of the main financial interests of your life. At the same time it will not be wise to take things too much for granted or to become careless in the handing of money matters as opportunities for deriving benefit could be lost on the one hand and there could be an experiencing of difficulties on the other hand through a neglecting of practical safeguards. Benefit will be derived through a creating of good will and by a proper cultivating of friendly associations as well as through contact with interests of a philosophical, psychic and kindred nature, but there can be loss as a result of imposition, deception and false friends, and through acting too literally upon the suggestions and advice of other people.  The inclinations to make money easily or quickly should always be resisted, for if this is given way to it can bring contact with dubious characters or a doing of thins that, st rictly speaking, are not straightforward.  
  The number THIRTEEN signifies that you will not find it easy to resist the urge to spend money.  If this urge is given way to unduly it will cause you to be extravagant and hence will bring times when you will exceed income and in consequence will experience difficulties.  Nevertheless, you have capacity to earn money, particularly when you are able to do the work or to give you attention to those thins that vitally interest you.  In those directions where you experience enthusiasm there will be opportunities to bring about developments that can react very favourably upon money matters. On the other hand, there will be occasions when the inclination to make money quickly or easily will be very pronounced and you will need to be very firm with yourself, resisting tendencies towards speculation or the taking of risks in the hope that you will make big money or at least sufficient to enable you to break away from conditions of work or service that do not appeal to you. Do not let yourself be misled by these tendencies, for they can bring future disillusion. Consistent effort will be necessary if you are to get the income that you desire. 
 
  The number FOURTEEN will cause you to be practical in the natural impulse shown by Aries rising. It is quite possible that in some way your work or certain of your personal interests and activities will be associated with money matters and quite a deal of trust will be placed in your integrity and honesty. The acquisitive instinct will be marked, and from a normal standpoint you will endeavour to conserve your financial interests and to build up a reserve. You will usually weigh up the risks you 
assist and help you. On the other hand you will always need to guard against trouble 
or loss through the deception or trickery of others, and at times through dishonesty, 
actual theft or burglary. There will be occasions w

46take, especially as regards speculation and investment, but if the end seems to justify 
the risk then you will go ahead. If you benefit you will use the money gained to strengthen your financial position, but if you should lose, then you will accept the loss in as philosophical a manner as possible and will be guided by the experience gained, in your future transactions. 
  Benefit can be derived through activities and interests to do with the artistic side of life, such as music, painting, sculpture; and sometimes through entertainment. 
  The number FIFTEEN denotes that you will derive money and assist normal as a result of proper planning and a courageous of plans into action. Many of your ideas will be practical, but you will need to be firm and watchful to see that others in higher positions do not usurp them and put them over as their own, thus denying you the rightful proceeds. The accepting of authoritative and responsible positions will aid the financial side of  life and, as a result of thrift you will be able to build up quite a substantial reserve. It is a number that is more favourable for investments than for speculation. At times worrying conditions will arise as a result of delays or through your vocational activities being disturbed by national or international difficulties, but your natural forethought will aid you in working through these periods. 
  The number SIXTEEN, although giving you the capacity to work hard in order to obtain money, shows that though you can obtain a very good income through your own work and efforts, it will not be easy to conserve or to save money because there will always be an urge to spend, and at times an inclination to take risks which you will not be able to control. As a result, money will be lost and obligations will be entered into that will cause quite a deal of future anxiety. In your case much will depend upon whether you are married or not, and upon the manner in which your partner handles money matters. If your partner is practical, then it will be easier for you to restrain extravagance and to save, but if your partner is similar to yourself  then financial difficulties will become accentuated from time to time. 
  The number SEVENTEEN indicates that money and income can be derived from more than one source or through the utilising of more than one kind of activity. Thus, whilst the main source of your income can come from your normal work, business or profession, you can develop an auxiliary source that will give you extra money. 
  Ability of a literary or kindred nature can be employed, interests to do with transport or travel can have some sway over money matters, or there can be a giving of tuition or instruction to others. Fluctuations of income and expenditure will occur; sometimes things will be very good, but there will be occasions when obligations will compel attention and in doing so will create a temporary sense of apprehension. Yet you will always have plenty of new ideas as to how to draw in money and, though certain of these will not be practical, a lo t of them, if knocked into shape, will be 
productive of benefit. You should, however, always be cautious both in the making and as to the signing of financial agreements, and should be aware of all clauses and 
take, especially as regards speculation and investment, but if the end seems to justify 
the risk then you will go ahead. If you benefit you will use the money gained to 
strengthen your financial posi

47conditions before you make the final decision. 
  The number EIGHTEEN will intensify your power of imagination in regard to 
money and, in may instances, will influence your decisions in connection with money 
matters. You will want to attract money to you, and once you acquire it your tenacity in holding it will be very strong, in marked contradistinction to your temperamental restlessness and changeability. 
  Interests of a domestic and family nature will have some influence over your decisions and actions and it will not always be easy to follow your own inclinations, particularly if you are married, in partnership, or have sons and/or daughters. Nevertheless, their suggestions should always be listened to, as on occasions they will be of value, either in advancing financial interests or in overcoming difficulties. Benefit will come through property, and sometimes through inheritance. On the other hand family upsets, squabbles, disputes can r eact adversely on overall financial affairs, 
or demands by the marriage partner or other members of the family can cause personal embarrassment. 
  The number NINETEEN shows to be very ambitious where money is concerned and will want to do things so as to have a large income, which in turn will enable you to entertain and to take a prominent part in social and public affairs. Fortunately your power of organisation is good and thus will aid you in the handling of people and affairs that are associated with the financia l side of your life. There will, however, be 
times when extravagant inclinations will require restraining and it will not always be easy to exercise this restraint because of a natural desire to have as many of the good things of life as you can. Unless you do restrain these inclinations you will experience periods when expenditure will exceed income, and as a result, temporary strain and worry will occur until such time as your resourcefulness has enabled you to overcome the difficulties. Speculation and investment will attract you because of the latent possibilities of making money, but it will be essential to maintain practically and not to lose your sense of proportion. Benefit can be derived, but there are dangers of loss. 
 
  The number TWENTY is a helpful number so far as money is concerned, for it draws out personal initiative and enables you to apply personal ability to the acquiring of money. Irrespective of whether your work is mental or manual you will find it relatively easy to adapt your activities to those things from which quite a degree of benefit will be obtained. You will benefit as well through home and family affairs, and this is a number that is often associated with benefit through inheritance or legacy. The constructive planning out of affairs ahead and the maintaining of a practical line of action will always bring you benefit and enable you to create a reserve for future eventualities. 
  The number TWENTY-ONE is another of the more fortunate numbers and signifies that financial benefits will be derived both through your own initiative and enterprise 
conditions before you make the final decision. 
The number EIGHTEEN will intensify your power of imagination in regard to 
money and, in may instances, will influence your decisions in connection with money 
matters. You will want to attract money to you, and once you acquire it your tenacity 
in holding it will be very strong, in marked contradistinction to your temperamental

48and as a result of the influence and support of people in influential and authoritative 
positions who will be well-disposed towards you. In many respects you will have a flair for speculation and investment, although in the former direction a degree of forethought should be exercised and you should not act too much on the spur of the moment. Sometimes matters to do with children and young persons will react very favourably upon overall financial affairs. 
  The number TWENTY-TWO is a somewhat contrary number in its influence over money. It shows that there will be seasonal fluctuations which can react on your work or your business. On the whole you have a good sense of the value of money, and though you will not mind spending money when you have to you will invariably try to keep a reserve for a rainy day. Conditions of health, both personal and of others in your family, will react upon money interests, and when ill health occurs there will be a loss of income should you be ill yourself, or an incurring of extra expense if someone else is ill.

CHAPTER SEVEN 
 
YOUR NUMBER OF HEALTH 
 
  The question of physical strength or weakness is of vital importance to everyone; 
for upon the maintainance of good health depends, in greater measure than may be commonly realised, the capacity to carry out the daily work and to bring about the developing of plans and activities in all directions of life. Ill health will react upon the earning capacity in many instances, and can disturb or even destroy marital happiness and the continuity of home life. If, theref ore, one is aware of one’s own peculiar 
strengths and weaknesses and the liability to certain specific ailments and complaints, one can take the necessary precautions to mitigate the liability to indisposition and to strengthen the general condition of health. 
  The number of one’s name, calculated in accordance with the Kabalistic system of numbers 1 to 22, will again give an unfailing indication of these strengths and weaknesses, and in connection with health two indications are taken. The first indication is given by the initial letter and its corresponding number of the FIRST CHRISTIAN OR FORENAME and it can be likened to the indication given by the Rising Sign in an astrological horoscope of birth. 
  The second indication is once again given by the WHOLE OF THE NAME, Christian and Forenames with SURNAME. The final number given by the whole name will correspond to the planetary or zodiacal vibration which will influence the life generally. As illustrations have been given in earlier chapters on the computation of the number for the name as a whole, there is no need to give a repetition in the present chapter; for once the number has been computed, then the health description given under that number will apply. 
  To revert, however, to the first indication; that which is given by the Initial Letter of the FIRST Christian or Forename. This is comparatively simple to follow, for all that one does is to take the number allocated to the particular letter which commences the name and then look for the appropriate description of that number. 
  There is, nevertheless, one distinction which needs to be heeded, and that is, when the first Christian or Forename begins with the letters TH (such as in Thomas) the influence of the TH should be taken in preference to the T by itself, thus bringing in the influence of the number 9 instead of the 22 which normally corresponds to T. 
To illustrate:- 
With the name EDWARD, the initial letter is E and the corresponding number is 5, therefore, this number gives the first health indication. This, however, will be modified by the health influence of number 4, which is the Kabalistic number of the full Christian name.

YOUR NUMBER OF HEALTH 
The question of physical strength or weakness is of vital importance to everyone; 
for upon the maintainance of good health depends, in greater measure than may be 
commonly realised, the capacity to carry out the daily work and to bring about the 
developing of plans and activities in all directions of life. Il health will react upon the

50  We now give the health indications of each number. 
  The number 1 in its influence over health shows that the general condition of health 
will be reasonably good so long as you do not give way to mental strain or worry. 
Directly the latter occurs there will be a reaction on the nerves with a liability to nervous disorders and, should mental tension be permitted to go to an extreme, to nervous breakdowns. On the other hand the maintaining of a cheerful and optimistic outlook on life, which you have undoubtedly the capacity to maintain, will enable you to keep in good health and to enjoy many of the social and pleasurable amenities of life and to do a considerable amount of travel. Travel, especially in country surroundings, will also be an antidote to mental restlessness and anxiety. 
  The number 2 gives you a neat and fairly compact form of physical body and shows 
that so long as normal supervision is maintained during the early years of life, good health will result. The sign has rule over the digestive organs and the bowels, chiefly the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, but also the mesentery, peritoneum, spleen and sympathetic nervous system. Any sluggishness of the digestive or eliminative organs should be promptly remedied as otherwise the accumulation of waste matter in the system can be the originating cause of other ailments of a more serious character. Some liability towards suffering from various forms of colic, affections of the intestinal digestion, neuralgia of the intestine, diarrhoea, and the other extreme of constipation, typhoid and enteric fever is denoted. A great deal is shown to depend upon diet as well as upon the climatic and natural conditions of the locality in which you live from time to time. Indisposition can also occur. 
  The number 3 gives you a well formed and positive type of physical body showing 
that from a general standpoint health will be good and there will also be good powers of recuperation. At the same time emotional upsets and disturbances will cause a temporary depletion of strength and vitality, almost as severe as a physical illness. The sign has rule over the lumbar region and the skin, the kidneys and supra-renal glands, and, from a structural standpoint the lumbar vertebrae of the spine. There is shown to be some liability to kidney disorders and to complaints affecting or reacting upon the urinary system as well as to ailments caused through an excess of sugar in the system. Any tendency towards jaundice, diabetes, uraemia or kindred complaints should receive immediate attention, whilst there can be some susceptibility to lumbago, gravel and stone. Catarrhal colds affecting the nose and head are denoted. 
  The number 4 gives you a good deal of physical strength and endurance and shows 
that good health can be maintained providing normal habits of life are followed. The sign has rule over the pelvis of the kidney, the ureters, bladder, gall, excretory system generally and the pelvic region of the body. Some liability to feverish ailments and those of an internal character is denoted and can affect the parts of the body that have been mentioned. Such complaints as gravel, stone, appendicitis and hernia can occur, whilst there will always be some need for discretion where sexual matters are

suffering from infectious ailments or when passing through or contagion. As a result of ailments there can be a reaction upon the heart, throat and back. 
  The number 5 gives a very favourable reaction upon health and shows that, with 
normal forethought, you will have good health. Even during periods of indisposition there will be compensations and the recuperative powers will pull you through ailments that could prove very disturbing to other people. You will, however, need to be practical where food and drink are concerned. For this number usually gives a very good appetite and hence should you go to excess there could be a building up of fatty tissues and a creating of impurities in the system which would react in the form of boils, abscesses, etc.; or in a derangement of the liver. By watching the general condition of the blood and the body these possibilities can, however, be eliminated. 
  The number 6 again has a very favourable influence over health and assists the 
general tone of the body and the powers of recuperation. At the same time harmony in the surroundings and agreeable personal relationships, especially of an affectional nature, are essential for the continued preservation of health. When emotional upsets occur or there is a disturbing of associations the subsequent tension will have a reaction almost as bad as an actual physical illness, but with an improvement in these conditions an almost immediate return to a normal condition of health is signified. The condition of the kidneys and of the eyes should be watched. 
  The number 7 gives you a strong and wiry type of physical body with a good deal 
of recuperative power, but shows that there will be times when a depletion of health will occur as a result of over activity, over-excitement or through a combination of mental-emotional strain. You should, therefore,  always try to regulate periods of work 
with periods of physical and mental rest, and should control restlessness. The sign has rule over the hips and thighs, the liver, and to some extent the lungs, therefore ailments can affect one or other of these parts of the body. The condition of the blood should always be watched, as any accumulation of impurities therein will manifest in the form of boils, abscesses and local accumulations of waste matter. At certain periods there can be danger of accidents through travel, sports or even through animals. In later years of life it is a sign that brings some tendency to high blood pressure. 
  The number 8 does not give too strong a type of physical body and shows that 
health will not be too strong during the earlier years of life, but as it is an earthy sign, there will be a grip upon life, whilst health is shown to improve considerably as age advances. There will be a susceptibility to colds and chills, to complaints of a rheumatic nature and to ailments such as asthma and catarrh. The condition of the digestive and eliminative organs should be watched and any sluggishness should be promptly remedied as otherwise there will be an accumulating of waste matter in the system and consequently greater liability to ill health. The sign has rule over the 
concerned. Proper precautions should be taken when you are in the vicinity of people 
suffering from infectious ailments or when passing through or contagion. As a result 
of ailments there can be a reaction upon the heart, throat an

52bones and joints, the knees and kneecap, and the skin. Aliments can, therefore, affect 
these parts of the body, whilst there is some liability to bruises and to hurt through falls or as a result of things falling upon you. 
  The number 9 gives you a fairly strong type of physical body, but there is shown to 
be a need for maintaining purity of the blood and for seeing that there is a proper elimination of carbonic acid gas from the system. Sluggishness of the circulation should not be permitted for this could cause poisoning of the blood stream and create morbid changes unfavourable for health, with an adverse reaction upon the heart. The sign has rule over the legs and ankles, and to some extent the eyes. Any tendency towards varicose veins, affections of the legs and ankles, or hurt to these through accidents or falls, should receive prompt attention. There will be some susceptibility to colds and chills, and you should not lift or carry anything unduly heavy or bulky. Sometimes the sign brings affections of the ears. 
  The number 10 is another number which signifies that the conditions of the nervous 
system will have much to do with the general health. When there is an absence of mental strain then health will be good, but should affairs deteriorate and cause mental worry or tension then there will be a reaction causing restlessness, loss of sleep, and an upsetting of the digestive organs and stomach. This number also brings a liability to illness as a result of sudden shock or accident, and the latter can be caused through travel, more particularly by road or train, or as a result of taking sudden and unexplained risks in either your daily work or in your hobbies. It is an unfavourable influence for such activities as mountain climbing. 
  The number 11 is a rather peculiar number and sometimes has a peculiar effect over 
the health. It is a psychic number and hence gives a receptivity to ailments which are psychic and emotional in their origin. As the imagination is extremely powerful, certain physical aches and pains can be misconstrued and there is a danger of believing that some terrible disease is being suffered when in reality nothing really serious is being experienced. There is, however, some possibility of food poisoning through partaking of tinned or preserved f oods, and during periods of illness care will 
be necessary in the use of drugs. Over-smoking should be avoided. 
  The number 12 does not give you too strong a type of physical body and there will be some need for guarding against colds and chills affecting the lungs and the respiratory organs generally. At the same time the sign, in an apparently paradoxical manner, is indicative of a good length of life. Therefore, if you take proper precautions when ailments do occur, instead of allowing any form of neglect, you can mitigate the nature of any illness and prevent more serious phases occurring. The conditions of the liver and feet should be watched, and cleanliness should be maintained at all times. There will be some need for care in diet, as you will find that certain foods, especially those of a tinned or preserved nature, can have an effect upon you somewhat akin to ptomaine poisoning. The nature of the water you drink, and of 
bones and joints, the knees and kneecap, and the skin. Aliments can, therefore, affect 
these parts of the body, whilst there is some liability to bruises and to hurt through 
falls or as a result of things falling upon you.

53other beverages, can react upon the general condition of the health, and water 
containing an undue residue of lime, sand or chalk would have an unfavourable effect 
upon the system. 
  The number 13 gives you a strong type physical body, good vital powers and plenty 
of what may be termed life-force. From a general standpoint it signifies that good health will be maintained so long as ordinary thought and care is exercised, but there will be times when you will need to guard against feverish ailments, influenza and illnesses that could affect the head and face. Some liability to hurt through accidents and to cuts and wounds are denoted and these can again affect the head and face. You will find as well that over-activity of either a physical or a mental nature will disturb the health, whilst when increasing interference with the normally recuperative power of sleep, and if these conditions are permitted to go on indefinitely, insomnia can occur. There will always be some need for guarding against physical strain owing to the tendency to hasty action. 
  The number 14 gives you a strong type of physical body although there can be 
some tendency towards stoutness as middle age approaches. Considerable physical endurance is denoted showing a resistance to ill health with a strengthening of the vitality. General good health can be maintained if you avoid going to extremes in any direction and exercise normal discretion regarding food and drink. The latter will be of great importance as usually Taurus is a sign that gives a fairly hearty appetite; therefore, if discretion is not exercised there can be both a clogging of the system with waste matter and a creating of an excess of fat, both of which can have an injurious effect upon the general state of the health. The sign has rule over the throat, neck, ears, 
eustachian tubes, tonsils, upper part of the oesophagus, vocal cords, cerebellum and the base of the brain, together with the eyes. 
  The number 15 us not a favourable number for health as it brings a susceptibility to 
colds and chills, and to illness or malnutrition as a result of neglect—the neglect of others during the later years. There will be a liability to hurt through falls or things falling upon you and bones can be broken, especially the bones of the legs. The knee will be a very susceptible part and at times can be affected by rheumatism. Yet in a peculiar manner the number does gives a very strong grip upon life and is often associated with a very long life, whilst, if  proper care is taken, the latter part of life 
will be better for health than the first part. 
  The number 16 gives a strong and muscular type of physical body, and the general 
health will be good, but there will be a liability to ailments of a feverish nature, particularly if a deal of overseas travel, or residence in hot countries occurs. Some liability to cuts and wounds is signified and can affect the head and face. Care will always be required in the handling of machinery, instruments and knives and anything of an inflammatory nature. It is a masculine number and hence more favourable for men than for women. The inclination towards the taking of risks is accentuated and 
other beverages, can react upon the general condition of the health, and water 
containing an undue residue of lime, sand or chalk would have an unfavourable effect 
upon the system.

54can lead to accidents. 
  The number 17 gives you a fairly strong type of physical body but shows that 
over-activity, either mental or physical, can react upon the health and cause 
indisposition. The sign has rule over the arms, shoulders and hands, the lungs, breath and blood, whilst from a structural standpoint it governs the clavicle, scapula, humerus, radius, ulna, carpal and metacarpal bones and upper ribs. Some liability to complaints affecting these parts of the body is denoted, such as bronchitis, asthma, pleurisy and other lung troubles, whilst nervous disorders can arise through mental overstrain, and there can be injuries to, or fractures of, the upper limbs as a result of accidents. Mental excitements or any form of undue study or intense mental strain will disturb the health and this can be caused through matters to do with work or with the more private side of life going awry. 
  The number 18 does not give too strong a type of physical body and there will be a 
great deal of receptivity to conditions in the surroundings and to matters regarding food and drink, so that health can be disturbed as a result of domestic worries and the stomach and abdominal region of the body can be upset through a wrong diet. At the same time the sign gives an undoubted hold upon life and is indicative of a good length of life. From a general standpoint it has rule over the whole of the chest cavity, the breasts, axillae, apigastric region, the stomach and abdominal region, whilst from a structural standpoint it governs the sternum, ensiform cartilage and part of the ribs. Aliments can, therefore, affect these various parts of the body causing digestive and gastric troubles, dry coughs affecting the chest and ailments in which there is a preponderance of fluid or phlegm. 
  The number 19 gives you a strong and well formed type of physical body and, as it 
is the strongest physical sign in the zodiac, it is indicative of good health from a general standpoint. It shows, however, that when you are indisposed you can suffer rather severely, although with care the indi sposition is usually overcome fairly quickly. 
The sign has rule over the spine and the back, the heart and blood, and from a structural standpoint the dorsal vertebrae of the spine in particular. Some liability to feverish disorders is shown and complaints can affect the parts of the body that have been mentioned. Undue excitement or over-activity can react on the heart. Treatment of an osteopathic and manipulative nature would prove to be helpful. 
  The number 20 brings a susceptibility to ailments of a functional nature, and shows 
that personal cleanliness under all circumstances will be essential for the maintaining of good health. As it rules the stomach and abdominal region of the body, some thought will be required in diet, and pastry concoctions should not be partaken of as 
they could cause digestive upsets. The breasts and the womb are also under the influences of this number and, with a woman, carelessness can lead to indisposition and to a disturbing of the feminine functions. Yet it is another number that is more helpful during the later years of life and is one often associated with longevity. 
can lead to accidents. 
The number 17 gives you a fairly strong type of physical body but shows that 
over-activity, either mental or physical, can react upon the health and cause 
indisposition. The sign has rule over the arms, shoulders and hands, the lungs, breath 
and

55  The number 21 is a strongly vital number and normally gives extremely good health. 
It governs the blood and the heart, and warns against any form of activity or 
over-exertion which could impoverish the blood or react upon the condition of the heart. Sometimes it brings a liability to disorders of an infectious character, but more usually during the younger years of life. Sport in moderation will help to preserve good health and the natural strength is shown to continue until well into the 60’s, but after 65 natural precautions should certainly be maintained and , despite the feeling of robustness, risks should not be taken. 
  The number 22 shows that the season of the year during which you were born will 
have a great deal to do with the general condition of health. If you were born in the Spring there will be a need for regulating over-activity and for controlling both physical and mental restlessness. If you were born in the Summer your vitality is goo but outbursts of temper could be injurious. If born in the Autumn much will depend upon your associations with others and your marital life. If happy, health will be good, but if unhappy or born in the Winter you will need to guard against colds and should always keep warm. Health will not be strong during the first part of life but will strengthen as age increases.

CHAPTER EIGHT 
 
COLOUR AND NUMBERS 
 
  In the same way as each number from 1 to 22 has its specific influence over 
character, luck, money, marriage and health, so it has rule over a particular colour, and the colour shown by your PERSONAL NUMBER, that is the number derived from your Christian name or names, will indicate your lucky colour and you should do your best to wear this colour from time to time, or to wear a stone or gem of this colour, or in which this colour predominates. 
  Naturally with women it will be easier to wear clothes in which the lucky colour is prominent; but even with men it should not be too difficult to find a shirt, a tie or even socks in which the lucky colour is predominant. 
  The number of ONE rules the colour Yellow, and the wearing of this colour will help to draw out the powers of intuitions and inner wisdom. 
  The number Two has as its colour Dark Blue striped with White. Its wearing will assist the capacity for study, research and investigation. It is very good for occult studies. 
  The number Three rules Light Blue, and in wearing this colour there will be an intensifying of the powers of reasonableness and of goodness. It is helpful for activities of a social and public nature. 
  The number Four governs Dark Red, and though care is shown to be required in the wearing of this colour owing to its intensity and its tendency to excite the feelings and emotions and to cause precipitate action, if this number is your Personal Number, then the wearing of Red will draw out courage, initiative and enterprise, and so long as commonsense is maintained will aid you in the furthering of your desires and ambitions. 
  The number FIVE has rule over the colour Violet, and its use in dress or by wearing a precious stone of this colour will draw out your love of truth, will cause you to be responsive to religious and philosophical urges and will give earnestness of spirit. It accentuates the vibration of Luck. 
  The number SIX governs the colour Blue in its entirety and shows that varying shades, from light to dark, can be worn. It will draw out the companionable side of the nature and will aid matters to do with the affections, marriage and partnership. 
  The number SEVEN brings a composite colour of Yellow and Brown. Its wearing will aid the intellectual powers and the practical carrying into operation of thoughts and ideas. 
  The number EIGHT rules Grey, and this is another colour the use of which will assist the power of concentration and of organization, and is helpful when there are

wearing it the factor of hope will be intens ified, while it aids the focusing of thought 
when there is need for the expressing of knowledge.

CHAPTER NINE 
 
NUMBER AND SPECULATION 
 
  The following chapter is written essentially from the point of view of the resident in 
Great Britain, although the principles expounded through Numerology can be used throughout in any similar way in any country of the world, provided one has the necessary local knowledge. They have greyhound racing tracks in Chicago similar to those in London. The dogs race out of traps numbered 1-6, and if the combination of lucky numbers succeeds in London, it could be equally successful in Chicago—or in any other place in the world. 
  In some measure the numbers forecast concerning the winning teams in Football can be made in any country where Football is played and fostered, for the purpose of gambling for capital gains. 
  Any information concerning stock and Share transactions can be used by anyone interested since a large proportion of Securities quoted on the Stock Exchanges can be traded in other parts of the world. 
 
Football Pools 
  Although infallibility is not claimed, it should be possible to work out a system of forecasting for football pools by the use of numbers. The name of each team obviously has a numerical value, and if the teams playing each other possess the same value, then the possibility should be toward a draw; if, however, the two numbers differ attention should be paid to whether the numbers are positive or negative. The positive numbers, as a rule being the stronger, should add to the team’s chances. A further check can be made by working out the number of the date on which the match is played—e.g. 23/1/1958. By adding the units of this date together we have a total 29 which, reduced to 22 or under in accord with the Kabalistic system, reduces to 11. All odd numbers are positive and even numbers negative. 
  For the convenience of readers we append below a list of all the football teams together with their individual numbers, taking first the total number and then the reduced number, again in terms of Kabala. The names have been taken according to popular use.

 In order to assist the making of a decision regarding the relative numerical strength 
of either team involved in a match, the number ruling the hour in which the match commences can also be taken into account. (The hour numerical values are given on page 78, Chapter Six.) 
 
  In addition, the number ruling the day, and the number ruling the town in which the match is played have to be allowed for. The number ruling the town should be computed in the same way as for a person’s name, the number of each letter being taken-from 1 to 22-and then added to obtained the grand total, and from this the reduced total. 
  The numbers of the days of the week are as follows: 
 
  Sunday, 1 and 4; Monday, 2 and 7; Tuesday, 9; Wednesday, 5; Thursday, 3; Friday, 6; Saturday, 8 
 
  To the number of the team should be added the number of the day, the number of the hour, the reduced number of the place where the match is played. The total number obtained should again be reduced to 22 or under should it exceed 22, and this final number will show the possibility of success or loss along the lines suggested in the opening paragraph of this Chapter. 
 
Stocks and Shares 
  In order to use numbers to forecast the ri se and fall of stocks and shares a slightly 
different system is required. This system calls for a certain knowledge of planetary 
influence over stocks, together with the vi bration of the basic number ruling the name 
of any given undertaking. For instance, Impe rial Tobacco, the total of which is 167 
reducing to 14 and then to 5 (in this system  every number is required to a unit) is a 
negative Sun number and the Tobacco is ruled by the planet Venus. Reference must of necessity be made to the current epheme ris to discover when there are good or bad 
aspects indicating rises and th e bad forewarning falls. So fa r as the Sun and Venus are 
concerned, the Sun can only make three aspects to Venus-I.e. conjunction (good); 
semi-sextile (slightly good) and semi-square (slightly bad). Venus itself, however, can 
make good and bad aspects to the other planets during the course of the year. 
  We append below a list of the planets and the undertakings which they govern. 
SUN: All Government stocks; precious stones and metals (except silver) and 
     diamonds. 
MOON: Silver; waterboards; soft drinks; land and property. 
MERCURY: Steam railways; newspapers; road transport; Municipal and  
         Corporation stock; plastics; printing. 
In order to assist the making of a decision regarding the relative numerical strength 
of either team involved in a match, the number ruling the hour in which the match 
commences can also be taken into account. (The hour numerical values are given on 
page 78, Chapter Six.) 
In addition, the number ruling the day, and the number ruling the town in which the 
match is played have to be allowed for. The number ruling the town should be 
computed in the same way as for a person’s name, the number of each letter being 
taken-from 1 to 22-and then added to obtained the grand total, and from this the 
reduced total. 
The numbers of the days of the week are as follows: 
Sunday, | and 4; Monday, 2 and 7; Tuesday, 9; Wednesday, 5; Thursday, 3; Friday, 
6; Saturday, 8 
To the number of the team should be added the number of the day, the number of 
the hour, the reduced number of the place where the match is played. The total 
number obtained should again be reduced to 22 or under should it exceed 22, and this

  Some of the numbers overlap with others so far as certain shares are concerned, but 
as broad an outline as possible has been given. 
  In the buying of stocks and shares one can, of course, do so during the hours of the 
day when one’s lucky and money number are operative, as shown in the table on page 
78, Chapter Six, particularly if  one does not understand astr ology; and this is really 
the simpler method. Better results will natura lly be obtained if one can buy or sell 
during the positive hours. 
 
Horse and Greyhound Racing 
  The use of numbers can be applied to horse and greyhound racing in a somewhat 
similar manner as that already described fo r the choosing of the prospective winner in 
a somewhat similar manner as that alre ady described for the choosing of the 
prospective winner in a football match. 
  The factors employed are (a) the name  of the horse or greyhound reduced to 
number 9 or under by the addition of the numbers corresponding to the letters of the name and their subsequent reduction; (b) the reduced number of the name of the place 
where the race is run; (c) the number of the day of the race; and (d) the number of the 
hour in which the race is run. 
  When these four numbers have been obt ained they should again be added together 
and the total reduced to number 9 or under by  the addition of the units of the total 
number. 
  The winning numbers for horse races  are: 1,3,5,7,9. The losing numbers are: 
2,4,6,8.

If the combination of numbers of any horse reaches a reduced total of 2, 4, 6, 8, that 
horse can be eliminated. 
  When the reduced total reaches 1,3,5,7 or  9, then again a process of elimination 
must be employed in order to see which horses have the best chances of winning. 
  If the reduced total is in accord with th e number ruling the hour in which the race is 
run, then the horse which that  reduced total signifies stan ds the best opportunity of 
winning the race; with the proviso that, if the hour in which the race is run happens to be ruled by one of the negative or losing numbers of 2, 4, 6 or 8, then the positive equivalents of these numbers must always be substituted, as under:- 
For negative 2 substitute positive 7 
For negative 4 substitute positive 1 
For negative 6 substitute positive 3 
For negative 8 substitute positive 9. 
  As a final factor in selection of horses,  the colours worn by the jockeys can be taken 
into account, and the number as shown by th e main colour (see Chapter 8 for colours 
and their respective numbers) if correspondi ng with the reduced number value of the 
horse in question, will  often help to point to the wi nner; or, from the standpoint of 
experimentation, the number of the colour could also be added to the other numbers 
and yet a fresh reduced tota l obtained. An interesting se quence of number factors 
could thus be obtained and, as a result of experience, the more relevant used. 
  With greyhound racing there is also a need  for a substitution of certain numbers, for 
only six dogs at the most take part in these races and, therefore, the numbers from 1 to 
6 only can be employed. 
  When the reduced total of all the f actors involved: dog’s name, place of race, 
number of day and number of hour, reaches a 7 it will convert to two; if it reaches 8 it 
will convert to one; if it reaches 9 it will convert to five. 
  This conversion is different from the conversion for the numbers of the hours and 
should not be confused ther ewith. The converted numbers in this respect have no 
relation to the trap number in which the dog is placed. It is the name  of the dog, with 
the other factors, that is employed. 
  Nevertheless, if desired, the trap number could be added to the other numbers and the selection based upon the re duced total so found; but in  this case there would 
naturally be an alteration, and the winni ng and losing numbers, as given for horse 
races, would not apply.  
  The method of selection in this case w ould be that the reduced number of the hour 
into account; for each hour of 60 minutes can be sub-divided into 15 periods of four 
minutes, and the sub-period number for the exac t time of the start of the race would 
then prove to be the more favoured number. 
   
If the combination of numbers of any horse reaches a reduced total of 2, 4, 6, 8, that 
horse can be eliminated. 
When the reduced total reaches 1,3,5,7 or 9, then again a process of elimination 
must be employed in order to see which horses have the best chances of winning. 
If the reduced total is in accord with the number ruling the hour in which the race is 
run, then the horse which that reduced total signifies stands the best opportunity of 
winning the race; with the proviso that, if the hour in which the race is run happens to 
be ruled by one of the negative or losing numbers of 2, 4, 6 or 8, then the positive 
equivalents of these numbers must always be substituted, as under:-

### Deep Analysis — Sephariel's "The Numbers Book"

**Core System:**
Sephariel (Walter Gorn Old, 1864–1929) presents two parallel numerological systems for market speculation:

1. **Unit System (1–9):** Each number 1–9 is assigned a planetary ruler. This is the simpler system where any number is reduced to its digital root. The planetary correspondences are:
   - 1 = Sun, 2 = Moon, 3 = Jupiter, 4 = Uranus, 5 = Mercury, 6 = Venus, 7 = Neptune, 8 = Saturn, 9 = Mars

2. **Kabalistic System (1–22):** Uses the 22 Hebrew letters mapped to zodiac signs and planets. Numbers are reduced modulo 22 (or to 1–22 range). Each letter has a divinatory meaning used for speculation.

**Application to Markets:**
- Stock/share prices are converted to their numerical vibration
- Dates are similarly reduced to planetary numbers
- When the number of the date harmonizes with the number of the stock, favorable conditions exist
- Sephariel provides tables for "numbers of speculation" showing which planetary combinations favor buying vs. selling

**Connection to Gann:**
- Gann knew Sephariel's work and incorporated planetary numerology into his methods
- The digital root / mod-9 system appears throughout Gann's Square of Nine
- The concept that numbers have inherent vibrational qualities is foundational to Gann's price-time theory
- Sephariel's planetary day/hour system parallels Gann's time cycle divisions

**Key Insight:** Numbers are not abstract — they carry planetary energy. Market prices vibrate at specific frequencies determined by their numerical composition. Timing trades to harmonize with these vibrations is the core principle.

USING PLANETARY HARMONICS TO FIND KEY REVERSALS IN 
THE MARKET
By TH OMAS LONG
The question of w hether the positions and ge ometries of the planets of our s olar system affect market 
action ha s been a long a nd hot ly debated issue. In re cent years, I ha ve been perfecting a method by 
which I be lieve to have put the question to rest. The concept is simple, and started with the research of 
my mother, Jeanne Long, w ho in turn w as following up on t he research of W .D. Gann.
My methodol ogy i nvolves a constant survey of pri ce vs. harmonic positions of the planets in the 
system. I do t his simply by c onve rting pl anetary pos itions into price, and not ing the points in price 
where planetary ge ometries occur. A s these geometries approa ch, the plotted pos itions of the planets 
involved approa ch one  another in price (plotted in line form at), thus creating an energetic price level. 
Oftentimes, a market will approa ch the position of t he planetary ge ometry and re spond t o that price 
level with pre cision, c reating a reversal. As I have become more and m ore familiar with the price 
patterns associated with market reactions to planetary ha rmonics, I ha ve learned that the market is in a 
constant state of action and re action to these price levels as they form  and di ssipate. The patterns can be 
related to those found i n fractal geometry, w hich resembles a random  walk unt il closely inspected. 
Indeed, the market is constantly expanding and contracting w ithin the confines of the price-energy 
created by t he planets, and this occurs on a ll time frames simultaneously, from  a one-minute to a yearly 
basis.
In orde r to unde rstand the concept of pl anetary ha rmonics, one  must first unde rstand the basic concept 
of the conve rsion of pl anetary pos ition to price. This is a simple concept, and w hen plotted in price 
creates a system of "pl anetary lines". All examples in this article were generated by t he Quick 
Harmonic Trader software. 
PLANETARY LINES
Planetary Lines is the term we use to describe the method w e use to conve rt planetary energy into 
price. A planetary line is basically the position of a  planet (in longitude) conve rted into price. The 
conve rsion is really qui te simple. If a planet, for e xample, is at a longitude of 187 de grees on the wheel 
of 360 de grees (using 0 de grees Aries as the starting poi nt), that would be equal to 1.87, 18.7, 187, 
1870, 18700, e tc., depending on t he price of the market you a re looking at. For stocks trading in the 10-
100 dol lar range, I assign a conve rsion va lue of 1 de gree = .10 dol lars, or 10 c ents. For stocks trading 
above  $100, I s witch to a conve rsion va lue of 1 de gree = $1.00. F or a market trading in the 1000' s, the 
value would switch to 1 de gree = 10.00. 
Sometimes, a stock may be oscillating ba ck and fort h across 100 dol lars, or a n index oscillating across 
the 1000, or e ven 10000 l evel. When this occurs, I us e the latest closing pri ce to define the conve rsion 
value. In a ctuality, there is a condition I re fer to as a "beta-shift" that occurs around t hese levels, where 
USING PLANETARY HARMONICS TO FIND KEY REVERSALS IN 
THE MARKET 
By THOMAS LONG 
The question of whether the positions and geometries of the planets of our solar system affect market 
action has been a long and hotly debated issue. In recent years, I have been perfecting a method by 
which I believe to have put the question to rest. The concept is

price will temporarily respond t o the conve rsion fa ctors of the two different calculations, and it is 
usually not  until the price moves above  the 150-180 a rea (or 1.50-1.80, 1500-1800, 15000-18000 e tc.) 
that price begins to respond s pecifically to the new conve rsion va lue. This is a more advanced concept, 
and w e will not dwell on it here. 
For my analysis, I us e only the geocentric positions of the planets (geocentric means as viewed from 
the Earth). I us e the positions of all of the planets, and the Sun, a nd also the position of t he Moon's 
Node (the point where the Moon c rosses the plane of the ecliptic). I us e the position on t he Moon's 
Node simply because it is a very pow erful point in space, and w e do indeed find m any m ajor reversal 
which are associated with aspects of the planets to the position of t he Moon's Node, one  of w hich will 
be used as an example in this article.
Chart 1 shows the positions of M ars and the Moon's Node plotted in price, ove rlayed on t he price chart 
for T eredyne , duri ng the period of J une-November of 1998. Y ou w ill immediately not e the point where 
the two lines crossed, at the low of the dow ntrend. T his point is the graphic representation of a 
"conjunction" be tween Mars and the Moon's Node. A conjunction oc curs when two elements are 
located visually at the same point in the sky (i.e. the same longitude). We are all familiar with a Solar 
Eclipse, which occurs when the Moon a nd the Sun are in conjunction, a nd ha ve the same declination 
(declination is latitude position, or di stance above  or be low the plane of the ecliptic). In s hort, a 
conjunction be tween two planets, or a  planet and the Moon's Node, is the most pow erful geometric 
relationship that can be produc ed. It can be said that conjunctions are respons ible for a  majority of 
major market reversals.
If we were to view the positions of the planets in a circular form at for t hat day (October 8, 1998), w e 
price will temporarily respond to the conversion factors of the two different calculations, and it is 
usually not until the price moves above the 150-180 area (or 1.50-1.80, 1500-1800, 15000-18000 etc.) 
that price begins to respond specifically to the new conversion value. This is a more advanced concept, 
and we will not dwell on it here. 
For my analysis, I use only the geocentric positions of the planets (geocentric means as viewed from 
the Earth). I use the positions of all of the planets, and the Sun, and also the position of the Moon's 
Node (the point where the Moon crosses the plane of the ecliptic). I use the position on the Moon's 
Node simply because it is a very powerful point in space, and we do indeed find many major reversal 
which are associated with aspects of the planets to the position of the Moon's Node, one of which will 
be used as an example in this article. 
Chart 1 shows the positions of Mars and the Moon's Node plotted in price, overlayed on the price chart 
for Teredyne, during the period of June-November of 1998. You will immediately note the point where 
the two lines crossed, at the low of the downtrend. This point is the graphic representation of a 
"conjunction" between Mars and the Moon's Node. A conjunction occurs when two elements are 
located visually at the same point in the sky (i.e. the same longitude). We are all familiar with a Solar 
Eclipse, which occurs when the Moon and the Sun are in conjunction, and have the same declination

would have seen that Mars and the Moon's Node were both in the same position, a t approxi mately 150 
degrees on the wheel (150.6 t o be precise). For a stock such as Teradyne , who's price range is between 
$10 a nd $100, t he conve rsion fa ctor is 1 de gree = .10 dol lars, so the position of t he conjunction 
between Mars and the Moon's Node can be easily calculated, 150 x .10 =  15.0. S o, the critical price 
level on that day was $15.00, w hich was, in fact the exact low for T eradyne  on that day. As you c an 
see, this low marked the beginning of a  very pow erful rally, which is the pattern that I would have 
expected as a result of this precise correlation of pri ce to planetary pos ition. I bought  Teradyne  on the 
first technical confirmation of a  reversing trend, us ing m y favorite technical indicators, initiating a 
position on t he open two days later.
You w ill notice that each line has its own particular angle, or s peed. M ars has a much faster orbi t than 
The Moon's Node, and so its angle is greater. Each planet moves at it's own speed, thus all lines have a 
different angle.
Now, you m ight ask, if the planet's positions are plotted from  0 to 360 de grees, and 1 de gree = 10 
cents, then how  can a planet's position be  plotted above  $36.00?  We simply add 360 de grees to the 
position to get to the higher levels. The next chart (Cha rt 2) w ill clarify this simply method. W e have 
expanded the scale of the chart up to $95.00. Y ou w ill notice now  that there are three of each of t he 
lines showing on t he chart. The actual conjunction be tween Mars and The North Node occurred at 150 
degrees on the wheel of 360. T he lowest crossover point on this chart is at that point, or $15.00. T he 
next higher crossover point is 360 de grees, or 36 dol lars higher, at $51.00. T he next is 36 dol lars 
higher, at $87.00. T his is just simple math. As an analogy, you m ight remember the chess board that 
Captain Kirk and Spock used in Star Trek. It had many transparent levels of pl ay. This is much the 
same concept, the planets play on m any di fferent wheels simultaneously, each representing a higher 
multiple of 360. 
It would be easier if all stocks and ot her markets traded constantly between 0 a nd 36 dol lars, but they 
don't, so we had to form ulate this simple translation. L ike many simple ideas, the proof i s in the 
puddi ng, a nd in this case, the simple answer works. In this way, pos ition can be translated to price at 
any level. Here's another example. If w e have an aspect that occurs at 187 de grees on the wheel, that 
would equal 18.70. Y ou w ould find hi gher aspect points in price at 18.70 +  36.00 =  54.70, a nd the next 
at 18.70 +  36.00 +  36.00 =  90.70, a nd the next at 18.70 +  36.00 +  36.00 +  36.00 =  126.70. 
would have seen that Mars and the Moon's Node were both in the same position, at approximately 150 
degrees on the wheel (150.6 to be precise). For a stock such as Teradyne, who's price range is between 
$10 and $100, the conversion factor is 1 degree = .10 dollars, so the position of the conjunction 
between Mars and the Moon's Node can be easily calculated, 150 x .10 = 15.0. So, the critical price 
level on that day was $15.00, which was, in fact the exact low for Teradyne on that day. As you can 
see, this low marked the beginning of a very powerful rally, which is the pattern that I would have 
expected as a result of this precise correlation of price to planetary position. I bou

The next conve ntion that we need to explain is the concept of "M irror L ines". This is another concept 
that Jeanne and I di scovered one  day ove r coffee. We were musing about the fact that markets in 
uptrend us ually follow the trajectory of a  particular planetary line. But  what about markets in 
downtrend. H ow could we define these trends when all planetary lines move upw ard? The answer, 
again, was simple. We simply inverted the positions of the planets across the 0 line to create dow nward 
moving lines. Here's how  it works:
If a planet is at 187 de grees on the wheel, it's Mirror i s at 360 – 187 =  173.
A planet at 98 de grees would have a mirror pos ition of 360 – 98 =  262.
In this way, as a planet moves forw ard one  degree of longitude, its mirror m oves backward 1 de gree, 
and the plotted line "mirrors " the actual plotted pos ition of t he planet. Let's look a t a chart of N ovellus 
(Cha rt 3). W e will add two Mars lines, one  which plots its "regular" pos ition, a nd the other which plots 
its "mirror" pos ition. W e will now  see Mars lines travelling upw ard and dow nward. N otice how  the 
downward moving M ars line defined the dow ntrend on t his stock for m any m onths. Now what is it that 
stoppe d that dow ntrend?

A planet at 98 degrees would have a mirror position of 360 — 98 = 262. 
In this way, as a planet moves forward one degree of longitude, its mirror moves backward | degree, 
and the plotted line "mirrors" the actual plotted position of the planet. Let's look at a chart of Novellus 
(Chart 3). We will add two Mars lines, one which plots its "regular" position, and the other which plots 
its "mirror" position. We will now see Mars lines travelling upward and downward. Notice how the 
downward moving Mars line defined the downtrend on this stock for many months. Now what is it that 
stopped that downtrend?

Again, we will add the planetary line for t he Moon's Node, and this time we will make it a mirror l ine. 
We will also remove the "regular" M ars line, so that we are now  viewing the "mirror" pos ition of t he 
conjunction be tween Mars and the Moon's Node. We can calculate the position of t his mirror poi nt by 
hand ve ry simply. W e know  that the conjunction oc curred at 150 de grees on the 360 w heel, so we 
simply invert this position, or s ubtract it from  360:  360 – 150 =  210. S o, we know  without viewing the 
chart that the mirror pos ition of t he Mars-Node conjunction w as at 210, or $21.00.
Our ne xt example chart (Cha rt 4) shows both the Mars and N orth T. Node Price Lines at the mirror 
settings. Note that this stock reversed on t he same date, October 8, 1998, a t the point where these 
mirror l ines crossed, or $21.00. T he low price on that day was exactly $21.00. I purc hased Novellus 
and Teradyne  on the same signal, from  a reversal on the same planetary aspect.

Again, we will add the planetary line for the Moon's Node, and this time we will make it a mirror line. 
We will also remove the "regular" Mars line, so that we are now viewing the "mirror" position of the 
conjunction between Mars and the Moon's Node. We can calculate the position of this mirror point by 
hand very simply. We know that the conjunction occurred at 150 degrees on the 360 wheel, so we 
simply invert this position, or subtract it from 360: 360 — 150 = 210. So, we know without viewing the 
chart that the mirror position of the Mars-Node conjunction was at 210, or $21.00. 
Our next example chart (Chart 4) shows both the Mars and North T. Node Price Lines at the mirror 
settings. Note that this stock reversed on the same date, October 8, 1998, at the point where these 
mirror lines crossed, or $21.00. The low price on that day was exactly $21.00. I purchased Novellus 
and Teradyne on the same signal, from a reversal on the same planetary aspect.

ASPECTS AND HARMONICS
A geometric relationship between two planets is called an "aspect", and w hen we refer to Harmonics, 
we are talking about aspects. The concept of pl anetary lines will allow you t o see not only 
conjunctions, but any aspect between two or m ore planetary elements conve rted to price. We do this by 
looking at harmonic divisions of a planet's position, a nd pl otting those harmonic divisions in price. We 
have already explained how  to conve rt a planet's position to price, and this allows you t o plot the 
positions of one  or m ore planets on a  price chart, and to visually see the points where those planet's 
paths intersect. These points of intersection are the points where the planets you a re viewing are in 
conjunction w ith one  another. This is an aspect on the first harmonic. The first harmonic is simply 360 / 
1, which is equal to 360. W hen you vi ew a planet with the setting of 360, you a re viewing it's 
ACTUAL position on t he wheel from  0 to 360 de grees. Moving inward through t he divisions of the 
wheel:
The second ha rmonic is 360 /  2 = 180.
The third ha rmonic is 360 /  3 = 120.
The fourt h harmonic is 360 /  4 = 90.
Most major reversals can be attributed to one  of the first four ha rmonics. Planets make conjunctions to 
one another only seldomly. However, they also make other important aspects to one  another on a  more

regular basis. The most important of these aspects are: 
●The oppos ition: This is where two planets are directly oppos ite to one  another on t he wheel. If 
two planets are in oppos ition ge ocentrically, they are located on e ither side of the earth out  in 
space. This is a second ha rmonic aspect.
●The trine: This is where two planets are located 120 de grees from  one another on t he wheel,

### Deep Analysis — Planetary Harmonics for Market Reversals

**Core Method (Thomas Long):**
Convert planetary geocentric longitude directly to price levels:
- 1 degree of longitude = 1 unit of price
- A planet at 120° corresponds to price level 120 (or 120 + 360 = 480, or 120 + 720 = 840, etc.)

**Mirror Lines:**
- 0°/360° and 180° act as mirror/reflection points
- When price approaches a planetary longitude or its opposite (±180°), expect a reversal
- Multiple planets clustered at similar longitudes create stronger support/resistance

**Harmonic Divisions of the Circle:**
- **Opposition (360/2 = 180°):** Strongest reversal signal
- **Trine (360/3 = 120°):** Major harmonic support/resistance
- **Square (360/4 = 90°):** Critical turning point angle
- **Sextile (360/6 = 60°):** Secondary harmonic
- **Semi-square (360/8 = 45°):** Gann's primary angle

**Practical Application:**
1. Get current geocentric positions of all planets
2. Calculate price equivalents (longitude + N×360 to reach market price range)
3. Mark these levels on your chart
4. When price hits a planetary price level, watch for reversal confirmation
5. Multiple planet alignments at same price = highest probability reversal

**Connection to Gann:**
This is essentially what Gann did — he converted planetary positions to price and time. The Square of Nine is a tool for doing this conversion rapidly. Gann's "natural resistance levels" are planetary longitude equivalents.

Most cycle analysis is doing one thing. It is trying to find the turning point 
of EVERY intermediate swing. For instance:
Here are some quotes from W.D. Gann taken from his last book,
How to Make Profits in Commodities
"TIME TO STAY OUT OF THE MARKET: This is something important for everyone to 
know. You cannot make money by trading in the market every day or by getting in 
and out every day. There comes a time when you should stay out, WATCH and WAIT 
until you determine a DEFINITE CHANGE IN TREND. Long periods of rest and 
relaxation protect your health and help your judgment which will result in 
profits later." 
"THE BEST WAY TO TRADE: The most money is made by swing trading, or in the long 
pull trades, that is following a definite trend as long as the market trend is

Most cycle analysis is doing one thing. It is trying to find the turning point 
of EVERY intermediate swing. For instance: 
Here are some quotes from W.D. Gann taken from his last book, 
How to Make Profits in Commodities 
"TIME TO STAY OUT OF THE MARKET: This is something important for everyone to 
know. You cannot make money by trading in the market every day or by getting in 
and out every day. There comes a time when you should stay out, WATCH and WAIT 
until you determine a DEFINITE CHANGE IN TREND. Long periods of rest and 
relaxation protect your health and help your judgment which will result in 
profits later." 
"THE BEST WAY TO TRADE: The most money is made by swing trading, or in the long 
pull trades, that is following a definite trend as long as the market trend is 
up or down, you must learn by rules to wait until the market gets out of a rut 
or a trading range. 
Wait for a definite indication that it is going higher or lower, before you 
take a position for a long pull trade. Always figure that YOU CAN BE WRONG and 
that the market could reverse. Therefore, follow your profits up with a STOP 
LOSS ORDER, or get out when you get a definite indication that the market has 
reached a turning point and that the trend is changing."

expired does any big move start up or down. The TIME factor will overbalance 
both Space and Volume. When TIME is up, space movement will start and large 
volume will begin, either up or down. At the end of any important movement -- 
monthly, weekly or daily -- TIME must be allowed for accumulation or 
distribution or for buying and selling to be completed. 
"Never decide that the main trend has changed one way or the other without 
consulting the RESISTANCE LEVELS from TOP to BOTTOM and without considering the 
position of the market and the CYCLE of each individual Commodity. 
"Always consider whether the main TIME limit has run out or not before judging 
a reverse move. Do not fail to consider the indications on TIME, both from main 
TOPS and BOTTOMS." 
"...when the market has run out enough time, watch for the first time that the 
market rallies a greater percentage than the last or first percentage, then it 
indicates the trend is changing. 
"But remember that the most important thing is the TIME PERIOD and when time 
overbalances or shows a change in trend, it is much more important than a 
percentage of prices. For example, after a prolonged advance, if a commodity 
has never reacted more than two months or one month, the first time that it 
exceeds this time period, it indicates a change in trend. Apply the same rule 
on the DOWN side. The first time the time period exceeds the greatest time 
period on the way down, consider the trend has changed, at least temporarily." 
"When a decline in cents exceeds the greatest decline of a previous reaction by 
one or more cents, it is an indication of a change in trend." 
"When a campaign has run only 3 or 4 sections and the time period on a reaction 
exceeds the greatest time of a previous reaction, consider that the main trend

What I have discovered is that EVERY trader is trying to find the WRONG thing 
in looking/searching for EVERY possible trade. I am right now, this week, going 
over a set of rules that point you right to the center point of the STORM!

And I have to say that a few people are just now seeing what I have been saying 
for a long time at my site. Most that have come and gone are not going to see 
this relationship with TIME and price. I am showing why Gann showed EVERYONE a 
very simple cycle that is ALWAYS the main part of EVERY cycle in trading. Once 
you have access to this analysis, trading should never be hard at all. 
And what software am I using to reveal this cycle? FT/GT4:):):) 
If any of my students are in this forum, they will indeed tell everyone that I 
have opened many eyes over the past few days:):):) It has taken a while to do 
this, but now they see why TIME IS MORE IMPORTANT! 
This was the reason for introducing my new system. Most people do not 
understand that they have to find only one thing to make trading a fun thing to 
do. If you spend time trying to get every single swing, it is only going to 
hurt the thing that most people want to get out of trading in the first place. 
Just in the past few days has everyone began to see this one simple cycle. I 
still have things that I`m going to bring to my students. All has not been

easy once you understand it was mostly about TIME. 
I have found that showing people pictures that show TIME is the key to everyone 
seeing the picture at all. Sound interesting? It is. Just think about that 
statement. It has taken a long time for most people to get away from looking at 
price. But, I`m telling you, once you stop looking at price, the trading will 
become very simple to do. 
I want to thank the people at Galactic Trader for making this GREAT software. I 
am now able to produce something that took sometimes up to 4 different software 
packages with pictures, to do what this software will do all in one:):):)

You can read every book in town about Gann. But none will really explain Time! 
Why is that? Gann didn`t explain everything. He left it up to everyone to do 
their own research. Most people think that these mkts. have their own 
individual cycles. They don`t They all work from the same time aspects. Most 
think different planetary settings are needed when you do a time calc. You 
don`t need that. Most people think you need price to confirm anything. 
Gann statement: Time is more important. 
My statement: Time is priceless! Trade TIME not PRICE in order to win! I don't 
care about the price. If the time is right, the price will be right. 
Do most people know that the main reason everyone gets out of trades is because 
of the mkts. at those tops/bottoms keep whipping back and forth so much. And 
they never really know that it is a top/bottom when they get into it at that

time! Most people spend so much time trying to get price and do not know that 
is what the big hang up really is. If you are in any mkt. at the correct time 
you will never need a protective stop! And I can prove that. This is a very 
hard thing for most people to understand though. It is because most have not 
seen how these mkts. are all doing what is called a balancing act. But, most 
have not found this cycle balancer. I have:) Every single mkt. turns with the 
same exact cycle! Every single time! 
It's a mathematical sequence of events that once in motion, MUST complete the 
equation that it has begun. 
Read this below very slowly. It will tell you a story that you may not have 
thought of before.
I asked Mr. Gann: "What is the cause behind the time factor?"
He smiled and said: "It has taken me twenty years of exhaustive study to learn 
the cause that produces effects according to time. That is my secret and too 
valuable to be spread broadcast. Besides, the public is not yet ready for it."
"Water seeks its level," continued Mr. Gann. "You can force it higher with a 
pump, but when you stop pumping it requires no force to cause it to return to 
its former level. Stocks and Commodities are the same. They can be forced above 
their natural level of values to where lambs lose all fear, become charged with 
hope and buy at the top. Then stocks are permitted to sink to a level where 
hope gives way to despair and the most rampant bull becomes a bear and sells 
out at a loss. My discovery of the time-factor enables me to tell in advance 
when these extremes must, by the law of supply and demand, occur in stocks and 
commodities."
This is what I have found!!! Every single mkt. does it!!!

What I have been saying is that there comes a point in time, where the mkt. has 
NO drawdown. This is the point I have found. And it works every single time:) 
Most everyone that has seen the Gann trading records, has seen the drawdown in 
his own trading. But, that is what drove me to discover the point at which 
there is never any! If anyone can do something great and yet does have a loss 
once in a while. Where is that point at which the loss never comes? That is the 
place everyone wants to be! This is why I have found this cycle that tells you 
where the mkt. will indeed never come back to! And it is all based on TIME:)
Dave
I have a site that is listed below. 
I am just now teaching this cycle to my students. What I teach is sort of 
backwards from what everyone else sees. Why? Because most of my focus is on 
TIME and not so much on price. As stated before, if you get in at the correct 
TIME, you don`t really need to be too worried about price. Why? Because these 
mkts. are moving away from these cycle points so fast. Most people that try to 
pick those tops/bottoms are going to get into those big skike moves that take 
them out. My cycle points are spikes that are going in my direction:) Gann had 
losses at top/bottom picking points. I have found that you don`t even have to 
come close to those points! 
I find it really interesting that with the way these mkts. work, I can take my 
system and lose 10 times in a row and still win big time with only 1 win:) That 
is how wild these mkts get once they get past this cycle point!

Interesting FACT: 
From continuous contract high date on 6/4, going 45^ clocwise... is 6/19. And 
6/19 is 1 trading day from the high on 6/22! Also 144^ clockwise from 6/4 high 
date is 327!!! ONLY 1 NUMBER OFF:) High price on 6/22 @ 326.70!!!:):):) Now, 
EVERYONE do your own homework. Because I have just taught EVERYONE how to use 
the Gann Wheel for FREE!!! 
And for more confluence/coincidence:) From 12/10 low date going 45^ counter-
clockwise, is 326 in price and 216^ clockwise is 7/17, 3 trading days before 
the 7/22 turn:)
Dave
Using the wheel is so simple:) Just take a look at the low date from continuous 
contract. 12/12/00 @ 696 in price. 22.5^ CLOCKWISE FROM THAT DATE OF 12/12 IS 
the price of 696, to within 1 number!!! Now, do the work from that date for the 
high. You will find all of this using these other TIMEDATES too... 7/9 window 
using 4/10 90CD and 1/22 120CD. Also, 7/12-15 window using these TIMEDATES... 
1/15 180CD, 3/14 120CD, 10/18 270CD and 2/20 144CD. How easy can this be:):):) 
Once again, do the work and you will succeed! TIMEDATES are to be used 2 
trading days prior and 3 trading days after the STATED dates. So, you can have 
many turns within one window. So, TRADE TIME, NOT PRICE! Trade the confirmation 
of the swings! 
I guess this is a second mkt. that has been nailed by the TIMEDATE window. 
Nailed by the 1/15 180CD TIMEDATE @ 45^ mark:) Both windows collided here for 
this mkt. Kind of a nice situation:) About 1/2 of a number off @ 1825 1/2:)

This mkt. has another TIMEDATE slated for 7/19-22 window. 1/22 180CD, 90CD 4/23 
and 10/4 288CD. Remember... Trade TIME and not price. 
The search for TIME has been going on since Gann died. How does TIME really
work on any PRICE chart? It is very difficult to show, since most people are
only interested in what the top/bottom PRICE will be, in advance. But, think
about this one little tid bit...
What if you knew where the TIME WINDOW begins? You see, this is what is so
difficult for most people to understand. Once you know when the TIME WINDOW
begins, then you find the TIME PATTERN. Once the TIME PATTERN comes, PRICE is
soon to follow! What most people do NOT understand is that there are TIME
PATTERNS that are repeated over and over again. And the markets are ALL turning 
in these SAME TIME WINDOWS. Once you can DEFINE the actual trend, then the 
entry, of the direction, is very simple. Why? Because once you understand TIME, 
you not only know when the market is ready to go, you know how long it MUST also
take. By this, I mean, that in order for it to be a trend at all, it MUST go
for at least a certain length of TIME. Or it is not a trend at all!
So, by determing the true direction of the trend, according to TIME, you have
unlocked the great mystery of Gann. Always looking for the TIME PORTAL!
"When wheat or other commodities hold 2 to 6 weeks or 10 to 13 weeks in a 
narrow range, then cross tops or break bottoms of previous weeks, the trend has 
changed and you should go with it." 
And as you begin to see TIME, you just by COINCIDENCE, begin NAILING 
tops/bottims:)

### Deep Analysis — Gann Wheel: TIME Is More Important Than Price

**Core Teaching (Dave / Gann Wheel Man):**
TIME is the dominant factor — Gann stated this repeatedly. Price will adjust to time, not the other way around.

**Time Windows:**
- Identify cycles in the market being traded
- Mark future dates where multiple time cycles converge
- These convergence points = highest probability turning points
- The direction of the turn is determined by trend analysis and price position

**Musical Scale Correspondence Table:**
Dave presents a remarkable table connecting:
- **Planets** → **Musical Notes** → **Colors** → **Numbers**
- This is the "Law of Vibration" in tabular form
- Each planet vibrates at a specific frequency that corresponds to a musical note, a color in the spectrum, and a number
- Mercury = C = Red = 1 (example pattern)

**Key Angles on the Wheel:**
- **45° (1/8 of 360°):** Gann's primary division — the octave
- **144° (2/5 of 360°):** Fibonacci connection — 144 is F(12), and 144° = the golden angle relationship
- These angles on the Square of Nine wheel mark critical support/resistance

**Time Patterns:**
- 30, 60, 90, 120, 144, 180, 225, 240, 270, 288, 315, 360 calendar days/trading days
- Squares of numbers: 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144 days
- Anniversary dates ± above divisions

**Key Insight:** The wheel is primarily a TIME tool, not a price tool. Place time (dates) on the wheel and read off future turning-point dates using angular relationships.

Gann Mysteries
WELCOME TO GANN
MYSTERIES
HEXAGON CHART
SPIRAL CHART
SITEMAPSpiral Chart
The Square of Nine  (originally called the Spiral Chart ) is a tool of technical
analysis  which was first popularized by famous market forecaster W. D. Gann .
[1][2][3] The chart first appeared in his corespondence course Master Charts[4],
which is now a part of the W. D. Gann Master Commodities Course[5]. It is
very similar to the Hexagon Chart[3], another chart described in the Master
Charts  course.
It is worth noting that Gann’ s original use of the term “Square of Nine” refers to
a completely dif ferent chart, and he referred to what is now known as the
Square of Nine today as the “Spiral Chart”[4]. However , for some reason, later
authors mixed up the terms and the name “Spiral Chart” has become much
less popular today[2].
Construction
The Square of Nine consists of the integers arranged in the form of a square
spiral.[6] One can construct it using a spreadsheet or graph paper . Place the
number 1 in a central cell; to its left place the number 2; below that is 3, to the
right of 3 is 4 and 5, then above 5 is 6 and then 7. To the left of 7 is 8 and then
9, which completes the first square. To the left of 9 place 10 to start a new
square out, and below 10 place 1 1, and so on. Below is a simple example
going up to 81:
81 80 79 78 77 76 75 74 73
50 49 48 47 46 45 44 43 72
51 26 25 24 23 22 21 42 71
52 27 10 9 8 720 41 70
53 28 112 1 619 40 69
54 29 12 3 4 518 39 68
55 30 13 14 15 16 17 38 67
56 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 66
57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65
Spiral direction
Regarding the direction of the spiral, it appears clockwise in some books[3] and
counterclockwise in others[7]. In the original chart used by Gann, the direction
was counterclockwise[1]. Patrick Mikula explains that it is best to spin the
numbers counterclockwise, because, onto the Square of Nine, Gann liked to
overlay astrological charts, most of which spin counterclockwise[7].
Angular value of each number
Zodiacal relationship in the Square of Nine
In the first volume of Gann Scientific Methods Unveiled[7], Patrick Mikula
assigns the following method to overly the planetary positions on the chart:
The axis going from 1 to 2,1 1, 28, and so on are 0° or 0° Aries , the spring
equinox  (in the Northern Hemisphere , same for below).
The axis going from 1 to 4, 15, 34 and so on are 90° or 0° Cancer ,
the summer solstice .
The axis going from 1 to 6, 19, 40, 69 and so on are 180° or 0° Libra ,
the autumn equinox .
The axis going from 1 to 8, 23, 46, 77, etc. is 270° or 0° Capricorn ,
the winter solstice .
Simpli ed form and universal fomula
In Predicting Market T rends with Periodic Number Cycles[8], Carl A. Futia
simplified the Square of Nine into a form which he calls the Octagon Chart.
Basically , the Octagon Chart only records the numbers on the Square of Nine
lying on the angles of the 8th harmonic. Here is an example:
IIIIIIIV V VI VII VIII IX
0° 2112853 86127 176 233 298
45° 3133157 91133 183 241 307
90° 4153461 96139 190 249 316
135° 5173765101 145 197 257 325
180° 6194069106 151 204 265 334
225° 7214373 111157 211273 343
270° 8234677 116163 218 281 352
315° 9254981121 169 225 289 361
To calculate any number in between these angles, Futia[8] provided a simple
formula, which is described in the following table:

### Deep Analysis — Spiral Chart & Gann Mysteries

**Futia's Square of Nine Formula:**
```
A = MOD[180 × √(P) − 225, 360]
```
Where:
- P = price or number on the Square of Nine
- A = angular position (0–360°) on the spiral
- MOD = modulo function (remainder after dividing by 360)
- 225° offset accounts for the starting position of the spiral

**How It Works:**
1. Take any price P
2. Compute √P, multiply by 180
3. Subtract 225 (the angular offset of the SQ9 starting point)
4. Take MOD 360 to get the angle
5. Prices sharing the same angle A are on the same cardinal/diagonal line of the SQ9

**The Octagon Chart:**
- Divides 360° into 8 sectors of 45° each
- Cardinal cross: 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°
- Diagonal cross: 45°, 135°, 225°, 315°
- Prices at these angles relative to a reference price are natural support/resistance levels

**Angular Relationships:**
- Two prices P1 and P2 are "square" when their angular difference is 90°, 180°, 270°, or 360° (0°)
- When A(P1) ≈ A(P2), the prices are on the same radial line — strongest harmonic relationship
- The formula mathematically proves that the SQ9 is a square-root spiral

**Key Insight:** The entire Square of Nine can be reduced to a single mathematical formula. This formula proves that SQ9 support/resistance levels are based on square-root relationships, not arbitrary geometric patterns.

Here is the picture. AB swing was used for fan construction and it projected point C.
The secret is to know which combination of lines is important per situation, what to look 
first, second,...
It works every time the same way, but in different variations. 
Most people get lost in lines and misuse them. They are action/reaction lines, not your 
fantasy lines.
That's the basic idea.
Those should be constructed first to grasp the pattern, and then point per day angles 
should be constructed.
That proves to be very effective.
If you do astrology, make astro chart for point A and another for point B, measure the 
distance between Merc on first chart and second. Project arc into the future
and see Sun hitting that degree at point C. To figure smaller moves make astro chart for 
every reversal and find moon pattern.
Can't say more than that. That's enough said to put Gann educators out of Biz or you 
never learn even if you hire an educator.
Do your homework.
////////// olga morales
For instance Earth moves 1 degree per day so you plot $1 $10 10cent per day etc. Venus 
moves what... 360/225days = $1.60 $16 16 cents etc. per day. This is what Lorin means 
when he says: "S&P is moving at the speed of Venus". Some people say price bounces in 
a channel formed by the slower moving outer planets at the speed(s) of the faster moving 
inner planets. Perhaps is does for some issues.
One thing to keep in mind is the solar system does not stop moving for weekends and 
holidays so if you do this right, your speed lines will be discontinuous on a trading day 
chart.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
There are number of ways to use Gann lines:
One is relative, shown in recent post - means relative to the last price swing, where line 
connecting swing high and swing low =1/1 in relation to the next swing.

The other one is kosher Gann, where 1/1 slope = 1 point per trading day. That's what you 
are talking about.
Also there is a simple way of constructing those 1point per day angles even your software
isn't designed for that.
Here is how to do that:
There are about 250 trading days in a year, that means 1/1 line will travel 250 points per 
year. So just draw a line from the first date of one month to the first date of the same 
month but in next year from 0 to 250. If you look at it that way, it will be easy and 
accurate enough because you deal with multi-month average.
Software isn't really a limitation. Your mind is.
According to Gann those are just the mathematical averages. It isn't necessary to make 
1X1 look 45 degree geometrically on chart. As long as 1X1 retain 1 point per trading day 
ratio you can resize the chart on your screen the way you want and angle would be valid 
as long as it keeps aspect ratio. So it isn't actual 45*, rather virtual or mathematic.
Even lines drawn in latest excel keep aspect ratio with the chart.
That what it is - the aspect ratio, not geometrical angle.
What's so difficult to understand?
In similar manner you can construct any angle:
Let's say you want some exotic Venus planetary trend line. Let's say you decided go 
Galactic, become sort of GalActor of the stock trade. Wow, that's like from sci-fi movies!
At least sounds cool. Do you think you need a special ware to look that cool? No. Just use
your brains, it's plain arithmetic - 5th grade or so:
Look up astronomical year tables:
Earth/Sun year 365 1/4 days per 360 degree. Means 360/365.25=0.9856 
points per calendar day or simply draw a square 1 year long and $360 or $3.6 or $0.36, 
etc, points high(depending on the market). Diagonal would be a Sun planetary line.
So what about Venus? Venus year is 0.62 earth or it would be a 1/0.62-1.6129 times 
sharper line - 360X1.6129=580.64/year.
So here is your yearly average Venus speed, draw $580X1year square and use diagonal. 
Real easy at least to construct and look cool. 
Making money will take more then that.
Squaring time with price means several things in Gann's writing. 
At certain places he refers to linear squaring - #days=#points in 1/1 ratio or other natural 
ratios.
The other one is kosher Gann, where 1/1 slope = | point per trading day. That's what you 
are talking about. 
Also there is a simple way of constructing those | point per day angles even your software 
isn't designed for that. 
Here is how to do that: 
There are about 250 trading days in a year, that means 1/1 line will travel 250 points per 
year. So just draw a line from the first date of one month to the first date of the same 
month but in next year from 0 to 250. If you look at it that way, it will be easy and 
accurate enough because you deal with multi-month average.

The other squaring concept refers to sq9 and to algebraic squares.
Last one is the most mysterious. Even Gann fully understood it he never clearly spelled it
out. Besides practical implementation would require modern computer technology as 
relations are non linear and would be very difficult to draw on paper or calculate by hand 
at times of Gann. All he came with is Sq9 and hexagon charts.
That's easy and works on swings.
But the true power is in merging both - linear and non linear concepts. I didn't see anyone
get to that point. At least it isn't published.
They tried in Gann trader something like that, but I don't think they connected all the 
dots. At least nice try.
It is still a relatively new field. There are many white spots.

As the years passed, Murrey has "forgotten" where the ideas came from :-) 
There are several ideas in the course which Murrey did NOT understand correctly. That 
is why some of the techniques seem great and some seem a little "strange". The starting 
point for the 4th quarter is actually the midpoint between the Earth's perihelion and 
aphelion. This date is approximately October 2nd. The date can be shifted due to trading 
days or lunar aspects (Full/New Moons, etc) which occur close to this date. Murrey’s 
"birthday, etc" is pure nonsense. If you have a copy of this particular Gann course you 
know EXACTLY where "Murrey Math” came from. I have "Murrey Math" charts which 
I drew over 10 years before I ever saw the "Murrey Math" manual :-)
Best wishes,
Bonnie Lee Hill
This was a course taught one-on-one to a very small group of people. This course has 
never been publicly printed.
In order to take the course, you submitted your natal information to Gann who then 
decided IF he would teach you. The price was quite high for this course.

Rule #1: Plot a stock/commodity in the units in which it is traded. Murry breaks this rule 
in a BIG way. He wants to plot everything in the range from zero to $100. That makes the
charts for things like sugar look VERY silly. THM also plots commodities like wheat in 
zero to $100. When you draw the charts, wheat walks right though the middle of the 
Circles of Conflict. This PROVES that the scale is wrong. If you plot wheat prices using 
zero to 100 CENTS, the price action looks much better. Bottom line, PLOT a thing in the 
units you use to TRADE the thing :-)
Rule #2: How the starting dates for the four quarters are aligned. Murrey did not 
understand this, and/or did not want to make it too obvious to the reader. Murrey Math 
students have to contact THM once a year to be TOLD the start of the fourth quarter. 
They wait with baited breath for THM's decree :-)
Rule #3: What price range to put on a chart. I can't explain it all here.
Several other basic rules.
Over 5 years ago, I sent THM a letter in which I listed over 60 errors in his book -- typos,
math errors, and errors in technique.

There is a very simple reason as to why you are confused about how to define Murrey's 
8ths. He is NOT consistent in how he does this. His software can be even MORE 
inconsistent :-)
Let's pretend we have a stock which trades at less that $100 dollars. We know we quote 
the price in dollar and cents. Therefore, the LARGEST square we could draw would be 
one which showed the range from $0 to $100. However, either the paper would need to 
be VERY big, or the plot would be a tiny wiggly line somewhere
on the page :-) We know that this large square is divided into 8 sections -- the lines are at 
$0.00, $12.50, $25.00, $37.50, $50.00, $62.50, $75.00, $87.50, and $100.00.
So, let's save a little paper, and figure out WHERE in that big square our stock is trading. 
Let's assume it is at $39. 
The price is less that $50.00 and more than $25.00. 
The next most reasonable chart would be drawn with the top line at $50.00
and the bottom line at $25.00. You will find that most of the time, charts with the ODD 
lines at the top and bottom seem to just work better :-) Our price of $39 sits a little above 
the middle of the chart. We will also have to set the time frame, but I am not worrying 
about that at the moment. However, if we are near the middle of the time frame, we 
DON'T want the price in the middle of the chart. This would put the price in the centre of 
the BIG central Circle of Conflict -- a definite no-no :-)
The chart that runs from $25.00 to $50.00 is 1/4th the size of our big $0.00 to $100.00 
(the REAL chart). We should always keep this REAL chart in the back of our mind. This 
second chart may be great for daily price bars, but it is TOO big
for shorter term trading. Again, we either use VERY BIG paper, or we use a portion of 
that price range. As the range gets smaller and smaller, we can't always keep the 
odd/even relationship we started with. However, we CAN remember what numbers were 
important from the BIG chart. 
Let me write out a list of prices with odd/even characteristics:
9th line, Odd: $100.00 -- $50.00 -- $43.75 -- $40.62
8th line, Even: $87.50 --
7th line, Odd: $75.00 -- $43.75 -- $40.62 -- $39.06
6th line, Even: $62.50 --
5th line, Odd: $50.00 -- $37.50 -- $37.50 -- $37.50

8ths. He is NOT consistent in how he does this. His software can be even MORE 
inconsistent :-) 
Let's pretend we have a stock which trades at less that $100 dollars. We know we quote 
the price in dollar and cents. Therefore, the LARGEST square we could draw would be 
one which showed the range from $0 to $100. However, either the paper would need to 
be VERY big, or the plot would be a tiny wiggly line somewhere 
on the page :-) We know that this large square is divided into 8 sections -- the lines are at 
$0.00, $12.50, $25.00, $37.50, $50.00, $62.50, $75.00, $87.50, and $100.00. 
So, let's save a little paper, and figure out WHERE in that big square our stock is trading. 
Let's assume it is at $39. 
The price is less that $50.00 and more than $25.00. 
The next most reasonable chart would be drawn with the top line at $50.00 
and the bottom line at $25.00. You will find that most of the time, charts with the ODD 
lines at the top and bottom seem to just

4th line, Even: $37.50 --
3rd line, Odd: $25.00 -- $31.25 -- $34.37 -- $35.94
2nd line, Even: $12.50 --
1st line, Odd: $0.00 -- $25.00 -- $31.25 -- $34.37
You will notice that $37.50 is an important price in ALL the chart ranges listed above. It 
is an important price in $0-100, and so we kept it as an important price in $40.625-
$34.375. We are CONSISTENT in the importance we attach to the 8ths.
As we move to smaller and smaller price ranges, there are two ways of looking at the 
operation. Number 1: we are saving paper by only printing a portion of the BIG CHART. 
Number 2: we are holding a magnifying glass over our BIG CHART and looking at only 
a tiny portion. However, the BIG CHART is always there, and we don't change our 
ranges so that we violate the characteristics of that BIG CHART.

Yes. Support and resistance in price can be calculated by measuring the difference 
between the current price and some historical extreme and converting the result to an 
angle using the square of 9. This was the basis of my approach to markets for quite a 
while. One can build a successful trading method around this. Calculating support and 
resistance in this way also led me to some important breakthroughs in understanding 
some subtle points about the use of the square of 9.
However, what one would really like to know is the magnitude of the bounce to expect 
once a support or resistance level is hit. I was only able to determine this after I learned 
how to square time with price. In my opinion time plays no independent role in 
determining market swings; it does however provide important information when 
coordinated properly with price calculations via the square of 9.
Carl 
The magnitude of the bounce is determined by the magnitude of the historical high/low 
squaring current price & time. Concentrate on calculating inner angles
of the square of nine not outer(Carl provided the formula of outer angles in post 252).

(((square root of time diff in 2 dates) - (square root of price diff)) / .25) * 45.
Paras in post #284 gave a formula for "inside angles".
This formula differs from the one for ordinary angles in the square of 9 which I posted in 
post # 252 in four ways, the second of which is only cosmetic.
First, Paras' formula looks at the difference of square roots instead of square roots 
themselves; this is necessary if one is to compute the angle between price and time. 
Secondly, instead of multiplying the difference between square roots by 180, Paras' 
formula first divides by 1/4 and then multiplies by 45; this is only a cosmetic difference 
because the result is the same as if we had just multiplied by 180.
Third, Paras doesn't subtract 225 from the result. This means that in contrast to the square
of 9 I use, Paras' formula places the squares of natural numbers on the 0 and 180 degree 
angles.
Finally, Paras doesn't reduce the result "mod 360" to be sure that the answer is a number 
between 0 and 360. I think this was just an oversight.
I don't use this "inner angle" formula in my work because I think it is important to 
subtract 225 and thus put the squares of natural numbers on the 315 and 135 degree 
angles.

I have yet to encounter an example of a market or stock that doesn't respond to support 
and resistance calculated by squaring price with time in the square of 9.
Of course, a very thinly traded stock or commodity might fail this test but I don't pay 
attention to these.
I am inclined to think that some sort of natural law is at work, but I can't for the life of me
imagine what it might be.
I did correspond for a while with a former member of the CBOT who used techniques 
similar to mine. He was convinced that the only explanation for the square of 9's success 
was manipulation. He believed that all markets were controlled by a gigantic, world-wide
financial conspiracy who manipulated markets for their own benefit.

I can understand why he believed what he did because of the uncanny performance of 
one particular method of squaring price with time. 
Moreover, one finds symbols which refer to the square of 9 and to this method on all 
major exchanges in the Western world. Typically these take the form of a square divided 
by two diagonal lines, a square divided into 4 smaller squares, oblique architectural 
references to the number 45 and representations of the signs of the zodiac.
Personally, I don't believe in conspiracies. My opinion is that such a large conspiracy 
could never keep itself secret for long. Too much money and power would be at stake.

Michael, 
Let me be honest here. I have not found a single method on Square of 9 which tells me 
the magnitude in price and time going forward. Then again I have not learned all 14 
ways. What I know from very credible sources from the Street is that the magnitude can 
be calculated by the proportion of the pivot you are squaring the price and time with. If 
you square it with bigger pivot then you get a bigger turn and so on. Then again this is 
one technique. Other one is as you pointed out that 90,180,270... are stronger than 30s 
As I mentioned before that there are 8 + 6 = 14 different ways you can calculate from 
sq9. Above technique is only part of one way you can find price and time targets. 
Where can you find all 14 techniques ? 
Well, you have work the commodity pits - if you can pay for the seat : - )

You have lost me here. I asked a simple question as to where you discovered there were 
14 different ways to square time and price.   I'm assuming your "8+6=14" has some

to the commodity pits and of course your NON answer, is actually the response I

Good Morning Dr. Narayan,
1.)  a. "Converting to degrees"  is done by taking the time of a swing and multiplying it 
by 180. This will give you the Time Angle of that swing in degrees.
      b. "Converting to degrees"  can also be done by taking the square root of the price 
distance of a swing and multiplying it by 180. This will give you the Price Angle of that 
swing in degrees.
2.)  "Mod 360" simply means, if the angle you get from the above calculations is greater 
than 360*, like 420, 720, etc..., then you want to divide that huge angle by 360 to see how
many 360's their are in that huge angle. Then subtract out all of the whole 360's and keep 
only the fraction of the remaining 360 that is left over.
     Example: Say you have a huge angle of 540*.   You want to get the angle down to 
something less than or equal to 360*. So, divide by 360*,   (540*/360*) = 1.5,   then 
subtract out the 1 whole 360*,   (1.5 - 1) = 0.5, this leaves .5 of one 360* which is gives 
you (.5 x 360*) = 180*, and this is your answer. 180* is the angle you want to keep!
Hope this clears it all up for you. :-)
Carson 
To briefly summarize (at least my understanding) of the concept behind this..during the 
1920's & 30's there were several folks (of whom Gann was one) who observed that there 
was a relationship between price moves and the square root of prices. Gann further fine-
tuned this idea by looking at the problem of predicting price moves in geometric terms of 
circles, rectangles, triangles, etc. The square of 9 chart serves a couple of purposes along 
these lines. First, it is a square root calculator (which came in handy before the days of 
computers). It also, however, arranges these "squares" in various angles and geometric 
forms. 
ONE such geometric construct in the chart is a circle within a square. To illustrate, look 
at the chart and find the number 21 in the lower right hand corner of the second square.

Now take the square root of this and add 2 and square the result. The answer 
(approximately) is 43, which is located in the lower right hand corner of the THIRD 
square, 360 degrees OUT (or up) from 21. This is the circle idea (360 
degrees in a circle). Percentages of this circle are of course also located along the square. 
Gann (and others of that era) observed that price frequently moved in increments of the 
square roots of price. And that's what the square of nine chart is designed to represent. 
You can create your own (more accurate) chart by using a spreadsheet to take the square 
root of a pivot low/high and add or subtract the 
relevant factor (from .25 for a 45 degree move to 2 for a 360 degree move) and square the
result. 
The above explains WHY the poster used 2 for the cycle. A close examination of prices 
for ANY chart shows that there are other factors besides 2 which are also relevant. That, 
in a nutshell, is SOME of what the chart is all about. Gann, it turns out, was FULL of 
observations on price moves, some of which are truly startling. Take a look at Michael S 
Jenkins Chart Reading for Professional Traders (all of the techniques in the book came 
from Gann and those are only the beginning). 
In addition to Jenkins, other sources that I've found helpful are the egroups here. Just do a
search for Gann and examine the archived messages. You'll find many other ways to use 
the chart. Other than Jenkins (and a few others), I'd be suspicious of some of the books 
and software available until I was more acquainted with the subject. 
Gann tends to attract the weirdest of the weird (no offence) and it seems most have felt 
the need to write a book describing their interpretation of the mystical meanings behind 
Gann's theories. 
In general, keep in mind that most if not ALL of Gann's theories are solidly based on 
growth/decay models of trading markets. THAT's why the square roots, divisions of the 
range, etc work so well. NOT because Gann was divining some tunnel in the sky crap. Its
amusing but largely junk. IMHO, of course.
 Carl
One approach is to look at price movement through a division of the range. Gann mainly 
wrote about this from a highest to lowest range (from what I understand) but other ranges
work very well. Applying Gann's rules about the different price behaviours at these 
divisions can put these swings into a perspective that makes a great deal of sense.
To answer your question about accounting for major swings in price...I think you need to 
first understand HOW trading markets grow & decay & WHY Gann/Elliott analysis 
works at all. 
IMHO the reason that any of this works is that it is capturing a snapshot of the "golden 
spiral" which explains this movement. The reason to look a snapshot rather than the spiral
Now take the square root of this and add 2 and square the result. The answer 
(approximately) is 43, which is located in the lower right hand corner of the THIRD 
square, 360 degrees OUT (or up) from 21. This is the circle idea (360

itself is that the spiral is subject to a great deal of "torque" from indigenous & exogenous 
factors and is ALWAYS twisting, turning & reversing direction. (So, analyst reports on 
the semiconductor sector, for instance, can send prices in a completely different direction 
& are an exogenous factor). However, the principle behind the golden spiral is that ALL 
price movement is related to previous price moves (that's the reason that moving 
averages, for instance, can sometimes be effective for future price moves.) This 
relationship is what square roots, divisions of the range, Gann angles, fib analysis, elliott 
waves, etc. is capturing.
Swings move in odd directions and mostly with a lack of seeming direction because they 
are accounting for the actions/reactions of a diverse group of traders, each with his/her 
own mindset. You can NEVER hope to understand where price is going specifically, but 
you CAN hope to understand where price has been and the future relationships that that 
might present (and, once again, that's where `these techniques come into play)
As for Gann's astronomical (not astrological) work, I have no question that it CAN work. 
But the REASON for its effectiveness, IMHO has nothing to do with astrology, 
mysticism, etc. Instead, EACH planet is on a patterned course through the universe. 
These patterns are rhythmical & consistent & have fixed relationships. They can be 
reduced, in other words, to mathematical formulas. Where these formulas HAPPEN to 
interact with the growth/decay "Golden Spiral" is where you can get action. There's a 
BIG difference between this, however, & claiming that "the influence of Saturn is 
causing traders and investors to buy IBM". The end result, of course, is the same. But its 
happening for an entirely different reason. Not understanding this causes folks to (with all
due respect to the Tunnel in the Air group here) invent all kinds of misleading crap. 
Put another way, IF the movement of the planets was totally random AND planet 
trajectories continued to interact with trading markets, THEN I'd believe in some 
astroLOGical connection. Such is not the case
Carl
Dear Carson,
Thanks for your kind answer to Dr. Narayan's question on converting to degrees. As a 
dedicated Square of 9 student, I understand the reason for converting Price and Time to 
degrees (to evaluate both these variables in the same unit of measurement). What I'm 
racking my brains on is the definitive meaning of "squaring" Price and Time. In other 
words, what condition(s) constitute a bona-fide squaring of Time and Price? Perhaps I 
can better explain myself via an example.
If we take the S&P 500 Cash Index (SPX)... on 3/22/01, the SPX made a Bottom at 
1081.19. Then 61 calendar days later on 5/22/01 it made a Top at 1315.97. Based on 
itself is that the spiral is subject to a great deal of "torque" from indigenous & exogenous 
factors and is ALWAYS twisting, turning & reversing direction. (So, analyst reports on 
the semiconductor sector, for instance, can send prices in a completely different direction 
& are an exogenous factor). However, the principle behind the golden spiral is that ALL 
price movement is related to previous price moves (that's the reason that moving 
averages, for instance, can sometimes be effective for future price moves.) This 
relationship is what square roots, divisions of the range, Gann angles, fib analysis, elliott

Gann's slogan of "When Price and Time are Squared, the Trend Changes", we can 
rationalise that some kind of squaring occurred on 5/22/01 (because the trend changed!). 
If I apply your degree conversion methodology to the above example I get the following:
Time in Degrees = 61cd X 180 = 10,980; Mod 360 = 30.50 Degrees
Price in Degrees = 1315.93 - 1081.19 = 234.74; then...
SQRT of 234.74 = 15.321; then 15.321 X 180 = 2757.78; then...
Mod 360 = 2757.78/360 = 7.6605; 7.6605 - 7.0 = 0.6605; then...
360 X 0.6605 = 237.78 Degrees
Now Time Degrees = 30.5 and Price Degrees = 237.78; What is the indication in these 
two results that Time and Price have indeed squared? (we know it has because the trend 
changed!) Again, what is the definitive indication that Price and Time have squared?
Greatly appreciate any additional insights,
Still toiling away...

Members,
I've been applying these calculations to the bean market with some success and some 
head scratching. Once I found the time degree, if space or price was off on a hard aspect I
reversed engineered the price degree based on the number of 360's I was removing to 
arrive at the exact number that would square price with the time degree. But some ?'s 
started poping up. How much time and or price movement did I have from the last low or
high ... ect.? It was tough to tell from just the degree numbers.
So then I remembered what I learned from reading some of Granville Cooley's work and 
that is. If there is a relationship between two numbers and if that relationship is valid 
across all numbers, then it must be there in the smallest numbers.
Now before I go on to what I found. Have any of you ever wondered why the even 
squares didn't fall on an angle line on the traditional square of 9 chart. I myself just 
excepted the explanations I've read. But in the back of my mind I always wondered why 
it had to be that way. well if you start with 1 as the first number it just works that way. 
But with zero occupying the first block then both even and odd squares are 180 degrees 
apart. This is what I discovered when I worked with Carl's calculations on the smallest 
numbers. What I was looking for initially was how many days or points was 360 degrees.
Gann's slogan of "When Price and Time are Squared, the Trend Changes", we can 
rationalise that some kind of squaring occurred on 5/22/01 (because the trend changed!). 
If | apply your degree conversion methodology to the above example I get the following: 
Time in Degrees = 61cd X 180 = 10,980; Mod 360 = 30.50 Degrees 
Price in Degrees = 1315.93 - 1081.19 = 234.74; then... 
SQRT of 234.74 = 15.321; then 15.321 X 180 = 2757.78; then... 
Mod 360 = 2757.78/360 = 7.6605; 7.6605 - 7.0 = 0.6605; then... 
360 X 0.6605 = 237.78 Degrees 
Now Time Degrees = 30.5 and Price Degrees = 237.78; What is the indication in these 
two results that Time and Price have indeed squared? (we know it has because the trend 
changed!) Again, what is the definitive indication that Price and Time have squared? 
Greatly appreciate any additional insights, 
Still toiling away...

Members, 
I've been applying these calculations to the bean market with some success and some 
head scratching. Once I found the time degree, if space or price was off on a hard aspect I 
reversed engineered the price degree based on the

10 = 344.20*
11 = 371.99*
I stopped there, knowing my number I was looking for was between 10 and 11. so I 
reversed engineered the math. I took 360+225/180 left me with 3.25, resquared that 
number and got 10.5625. I then got out my square of 9 chart and found the number 10. I 
noticed 27 is one cycle away and thought then that well 27.5625 must be 720 degrees of 
movement. All one has to do is sqrt that number and you have your answer.
Anyway by applying what I now know I was able to easily find every turn in may beans 
and understand the squaring. At first I couldn't find the exact square on the lastest low 
until I worked with the contract low. It's relationship to the low is an exact square with 
Carl's calculation. Now as far as one's ability to project future 
turns with this method I believe you'll have to be intimate with that market. Know 
through back testing and lots of note taking to determine a markets movements in not 
only reactions but bull and bear runs.

I don't claim to be expert in the use of the Sq of 9 by any means, but I too have run across
some of the difficulties you mention.   You say you picked a high and a  low.  I don't think 
every high and low are related to  each other by time/price, but swings are related to some
previous high/low by squaring.   I have found it useful to calculate price and time from 
several previous swing points - e.g. in an uptrend, calculate from major lows, retracement
lows, previous highs, etc. to find a relationship.   Which point creates the T/P square may 
have a lot to do with the overall structure of the trend - is this an intermediate wave or the
culmination of a major advance, etc.   Retracement rallies may eventually square out with 
previous highs within the larger trend, etc.  
 
I just sat down with a bond chart from 1995 last night and worked out some of the 
squaring in that major advance.   Most highs had a relationship with the major trend low, 
1=315* 
2 = 29.55* 
3 = 86.76* 
4 = 135* 
5 = 177.49*

but some were also related to previous swing lows.   Retracements seemed to vary 
relationships with the previous swing, previous retracements, etc.   I found the final top in 
1996 to be related to the previous intermediate low, but not in any neat fashion with the 
big low of July 1995.   I have more work to do, but this opened up some new lines of 
inquiry for me in trying to figure out how to anticipate the length of moves, expected 
retracements, etc.
 
Another help in "finding the square" was Stuart's point about projecting price levels from 
the known Time angle.   I found that relationships that did not seem to be related at first 
glance could be seen in a better light when I calculated that the ideal square to the time 
angle was really only 2-3 ticks away from the actual price move.   The math can make it 
look like a bigger miss than it actually is (Gann's "lost motion").
 
Hope this helps in some way.   I would love to hear what others have found in their travels
with the Sq9.

What I have done so far for bonds is use number of ticks travelled as the price move to 
sqrt.  Being fluent in bond-ese, I use the decimal equivalent of each price (e.g. 111-17 = 
111.531, 98-1 = 98.031) to figure the number of points in decimal and multiply by 32 (# 
ticks in a point) to get total ticks.   Normal people just have to remember that the contracts
trade in 32nds when calculating the difference in prices.
 
Example: 104-11 to 102-17 is 58 ticks.   104.344 - 102.531 = 1.813 x 32 = 58.016 (diff 
due to rounding to 3 decimals).   Or, 11 ticks down to 104, 32 ticks down to 103, 15 ticks 
(32 - 17) down to 102-17.   11+32+15 = 58.
 
For bigger moves, I plan to examine number of points travelled and whether these square 
with weekly or monthly time counts.   I'll post results if I find anything of interest.
 
Greg
OK how about this? 10411-10517= 58tics. Square root of 58 = 7.615. 
Add 1 and resquare 8.615 = 74.2. 9411-10200 today's low was 75 tics.
Square root of 75 = 8.66 x180=1558.84-225=1333.84MOD=253.84.
Number of days from 1/16(9411high)-1/23(10200low)=7. 
Square root of 7 = 2.64 x 180=476.2-225=251.
Is that close enough?

While doing research on W. D. Gann in the Boston libraries recently,  I 
came across a copy of Karl Anderson's "Astrology of the Old Testament 
or the Lost Word Regained" (1892) in Widener Library at Harvard. It 
was given to the Harvard library by the author and dedicated to "the 
students."
The title interested me immediately, because it embraced: a) Gann's 
now-noted enthusiasm for astrology; b) Gann's much-proclaimed regard 
for the Bible as a sourcebook; and c) Gann's interest in the "lost word" 
of freemasonry, treated in his own last book, "The Magic Word."
What struck me in particular while examining Anderson's work was the 
attached illustration. Indeed, I sat transfixed for many minutes, 
looking meditatively at this picture  in the silence of the reading room.
I note that Anderson  has written on the left-hand side, at the 270 degree 
point, "Mystery of the Pyramid," and we know that Gann was much 
taken by studies of the Great Pyramid of Giza.  On the bottom or 0 
degree point, Anderson has written, "Mystery of 5 Pointed Star," or the 
pentagram, which is alluded to among other things the symbol of the 
Lone Star State (p. 1 of "The Tunnel Thru the Air").
Some Gann Squares of Nine have concentric circles on them such as 
Anderson has drawn on his own illustration. There are also squares and 
triangles in Anderson's picture  as well. These facts are particularly 
interesting in light of comments by Daniel Ferrera concerning the 
Square of Nine:
"In Ganns Master Course for Stocks he said 'Within the circle forms the 
square, there is an inner circle and an inner square, as well as an outer 
square and an outer circle which prove the Fourth Dimension in working
out price movements.' So far, we have covered the inner circle (The 
Earths Orbit around the Sun) and the inner square (Historic high & low 
coordinates on the square itself).  The outer circle includes all of the 
planets and is the Zodiac starting at the left side of the square also on 
March 21st. Moving from this point clockwise in 30 degree sections of

triangles, when we add two triangular numbers we get a square. For example, 6 + 10 =

561 is the SUMMATION of all numbers from 1 to 33.   The formula is n/2 x (n+1)
 
n=33, so n/2 = 33/2 = 16.5
n+1 = 33+1 = 34
multiply these together 16.5 x 34 = 561.

General ways to use Square of Nine!
 
1. THIS IS THE BEST ONE I HAVE FOUND - TIME:
 
- Take Two Dates say the birth day of yours and your wife.
- Get the difference of dates.   Look it up on the Square of Nine
- If you are compatible the dates should fall on either the Cardinal Cross
  line (like mine and my wife's) or the Fixed Cross
 
- You apply the same principles to Trend Change Dates in the markets
both past and future.
 
 
2. PLANETS - THIS IS THE WORST ONE I HAVE FOUND
   (by the way this was the most expensive thing I have paid for in Gann)
- Take the Geocentric location of the Planets
- Lay those positions down on the Square of Nine
- Use the Angles or Rays to determine market Price and Time resistance
- If you want to really make a mess of the page you can use the Mean of the 5 Visible 
Planets positions.   Or the 6 planets closest to the sun or the 8 planets etc.
- Waste of Time but you can charge heaps for it!
 
3. MOST OBVIOUS ONE
 
Use it for price and time moves relatively and see if Changes Occur on Angles of 180 90 
270 etc 120 etc degrees from other Price and Time  Trend Change Points.
 
Try using that for your trading and you will come up with lots of possibilities for 
confusion!

I don't know of anyone who agrees with me, but it is my eccentric opinion that the square
of 9 is the key to the markets.
What's wrong with the examples in Sq of 9 posts # 105 and 106 and in Gannsghost posts 
# 7459, 7460 and 7462?
Carl
As a general principle If you start any date calcs using the natural year you start at 21 
March Equinox (Ingress) for northern hemisphere 21 Sep Southern Hemisphere. You can
also use Solar Degrees in place  of Calendar Days of course.

You are right. The Square of 9 is a square root calculator. It converts numbers to angles 
in a way that is easy to do with a hand calculator (the method I use). See my post # 5463 
on Gannsghost. 
I don't know how people can get away selling the square of 9 for hundreds of dollars 
except by taking advantage of other people's ignorance (mathematical and otherwise).
I do believe that the Square of 9 holds the key to the markets and can be used to trade 
successfully all by itself. I have a friend who claims that the uncanny ability of the square
of 9 to identify trend changes is proof that the markets are manipulated. He thinks that a 
financial conspiracy uses the square of 9 as a mathematical signalling tool to coordinate

Gann once wrote that every high and low is mathematically related to previous highs and 
lows. I believe that this is the case. However, there are many highs and lows to choose 
from, to say nothing of the numerous possible mathematical relationships which might 
exist among them. 
I don't know of anyone who agrees with me, but it is my eccentric opinion that the square 
of 9 is the key to the markets. 
What's wrong with the examples in Sq of 9 posts # 105 and 106 and in Gannsghost posts 
# 7459, 7460 and 7462?

As a general principle If you start any date calcs using the natural year you start at 21 
March Equinox (Ingress) for northern hemisphere 21 Sep Southern Hemisphere. You can 
also use Solar Degrees in place of Calendar Days of course.

You are right. The Square of 9 is a square root calculator. It converts numbers to angles 
in a way that is easy to do with a hand calculator (the method I use). See my post # 5463 
on Gannsghost. 
I don't know how people can get away selling the square of 9 for hundreds of dollars 
except by taking advantage of other people's ignorance (mathematical and otherwise). 
I do believe that the Square of 9 holds the key to the markets and can be used to trade 
successfully all by itself. I have a friend who claims that the uncanny ability of the square 
of 9 to identify trend changes is proof that the markets are manipulated. He thinks that a 
financial conspiracy uses the square of 9 as a mathematical signalling tool to coordinate 
the trades of its members. (I do not happen to share this belief.)

When doing research along these lines I have found that the best guideline to follow is to 
keep things as simple as possible. Someone once told me that if a market technique is to 
work it must be simple, because the truth about the market is basically simple. Also, I 
have found it useful to imagine that the market is manipulated via a mathematical 
signalling tool which coordinates the trades of "those in the know". Any such 
mathematical signalling has to be simple and based on obvious price/time points. For 
example, the S&P projections I make now are based in part on the 9/21 low at 939.
As I have said many times on this list and on Gannsghost, I don't believe that pure time 
counts starting from some extreme and projecting some future trend change date are of 
much use. Almost all the techniques I described in the two booklets I wrote 20 years ago 
were of this type, and I don't use any of these today. Instead I have found a way to square 
price with time using the square of 9. This is the only tool you need to trade any market.
Carl
In my own work with the square of 9 I don't use any tables, wheels or charts which 
purport to display the square of 9. In fact, the only reason I even use the term "the square 
of 9" is to be able to communicate with other people by using terminology they 
understand.
The only "square of 9" I use is my TI-30 hand calculator and especially its square and 
square root functions.
I think the dates one finds displayed around the various "square of 9" wheels sold to the 
public are interesting but irrelevant to calculating support and resistance.
As to which way the numbers spiral around the chart, I think that they should increase as 
one moves from 0 to 45 to 90 degrees etc. because this is the way that corresponds to the 
calculations of square roots.
The only examples I can offer are those which I have posted on Gannsghost and 
Gannsquareofnine during the past three months.

thanks for these very interesting messages on gann's square of nine.
if you were to use the square of nine for the futures of the principal indices in the market 
(the dow, the nasdaq, and the s&p 500) -- and i'm thinking of the e-minis here -- what 
value would you use to start with in the square of nine? what would be the right 
"increment" (i'm thinking here of gann's passion for 1x1 charts, where one unit of time = 
one unit of price)?

I do not think that there is a single "correct" answer to the question of just what price 
increment should correspond to one unit in the square of 9.
As a general rule I choose increments that are powers of 10 (e.g. .01. .10, 1.0, 10, or 100 
cents, dollar, points or whatever the basic unit of quotation is).
The increment you choose will depend on two things. First, what is your trading time 
frame? Smaller increments are useful for analysing smaller trends, bigger increments for 
bigger trends. Second, how volatile is the market? I think that when the S&P's were 
trading in the low hundreds you would want to use increments which were smaller than 
the ones you use now when they are trading above 1000.
There is no magic, right answer to this question. It all depends on what you are trying to 
accomplish. My own choice of increments is not something I care to discuss because I 
don't wish to make it easy for others to duplicate my analysis.
Carl
Lee & Carl: 
Lee, a sq9 is a set of numbers starting from one and spiralling out till infinity.  A Gann 
Wheel is the same set of numbers but with a circle of dates around the sq9.  These dates 
can be used to compare time on the GW with prices in the sq9. 
There are many possibilities for Gann Wheels and sq9.  First the numbers in a spiral can 
progress in either a clockwise manner or counterclockwise from the center.  Next the 
dates around the GW can also go clockwise or counterclockwise but in addition the 
starting points for the dates can start in various places.  One starts from March 21, 
another from Sep 21 and a third from June 7th. 
Carl, you stated: "The only "square of 9" I use is my TI-30 hand calculator and 
especially its square and square root functions."   I also use this technique but there has 
always been a problem.  I cannot tell when time and price are squared because I never 
know what number (factor) to use.  I end up with a series of times and prices after the fact
and try to verify that the last high or low was a turning point by comparing different 
times with the prices. 
If I use factors that are too small, I can verify any price with any time.  If the factors are 
too large, nothing can be verified.  There is no way to know exactly what factor to use in 
advance.  This has always been an insurmountable problem which is why I turned to a

The basic principle underlying market movements is that they tend to occur in muliples 
of 90 degrees. In the square of 9 this translates into adding or subtracting multiples of 0.5 
to or from the square root of the starting point price.
Of course there are many multiples of .5 to choose from (to say nothing of many possible 
starting points). This is why it is necessary to consider the time element by squaring price
with time. 
I believe that it is possible to develop a profitable trading method using only price and the
square of 9. This is the route I took to "enlightenment". But to completely understand the 
market and to be able to distinguish temporary halts from the end of the trend itself one 
must learn to incorporate the time element as well.

In every Gann wheel I have ever seen the dates displayed around the circumference of the
wheel are of no real use in calculating support and resistance.
I just don't see how anyone can get away with selling such a thing for more than the cost 
of materials.
I think it is very important to keep in mind the following basic fact.
The people who sell courses and books on Gann techniques most certainly do not know 
the "secret of the market" (if there is such a thing- I for one do think there is). If they did 
know of such a secret they certainly wouldn't reveal it to the public for a few hundred or 
for a few thousand dollars! 
Instead the seminar givers and course sellers know some things that work some of the 
time, but when it comes to applying them to real time trading they always need to use 
some form of standard technical analysis to assist the Gann techniques they know.
I think you have to approach this whole subject with that in mind. The materials, books, 
seminars are just a starting point (a good one) for your search for the truth. By its very 
nature the truth about how the markets work can never be given to you. You must 
discover on your own if you find it at all. If you discover it the truth will remain safe with
you because you will have no reason to sell it to anybody. You will have worked too hard
for too many years to sell it for a few hundred or a few thousand dollars in a seminar or a 
GW to hopefully determine another way to identify time or price. At this point I do not 
see any way out of this dilemma.

I might add parenthetically that I don't believe that Gann himself knew the truth about

I measure time using the calendar time which elapses between two dates. As I have often 
said on this list, I don't think planetary movements are of much use for calculating 
support and resistance and especially not in conjunction with the square of 9.
Time is in some sense "coarser" than price. For example, I have never had any success 
measuring time in minutes or hours as one might be tempted to do for day trading 
purposes. This is consonant with my basic model of the market which is that it behaves as
if it were manipulated by people who share a similar mathematical approach to markets 
and thereby coordinate their trades. This would be too hard to do if time had to be 
measured in minutes or hours.
Intraday movements certainly are controlled by price-square-time calculations. However, 
in my own work I also use pure price calculations to identify intraday turning points (for 
the purpose of fading reactions against the bigger trend). So I guess I am saying that for 
day-trading purposes you probably can rely only on price calculations using the square of
9, but to determine the direction of the bigger trend time must be incorporated into the 
analysis.

First of all I want to thank you for sharing your vast experience and knowledge of this 
enneagram thing. I have been studying your posts and have had some success 
understanding them. May I ask how you calculate time degrees? Do I use the eqn. you 
provided in GG 5462:
time deg = mod 360 ( 180 * (cd)^.5 -225 ) 
or do I use something along the lines of what Brian Skelenka showed us?
time deg = 180 * cd 
where cd = calendar days. For example in your GE example:
H = 60.75 (on 7/28/2000)
L = 28.5 (9/21/2001) 
where I get:
Trading Days: 289 = 315 deg or 52.02 deg using BJS method
Calendar Days: 420 = 224 deg or 75.6 " " " "
Price Range: 31.20 = 60 deg
High: 60.00 = 89 deg
Low: 28.80 = 21 deg
you said at the low time and price were conjunct at 135 deg. For the life of me I cannot 
find that 135 degrees. Help! Also in your opinion, does it matter whether or not we start 
the square with a one or a zero in the centre? For that matter, when/why would anyone 
put a number other than 1 or zero in the centre of the sq of 9? I noticed your equation 
uses zero. 
Thanks

Your first equation (copied just below) is the correct one.
> time deg = mod 360 ( 180 * (cd)^.5 -225 ) 
> where cd = calendar days. 
The reason you cannot find 135 degrees is more complicated. 
The main explanation is that I made a key punch error when I did the calculation (a 
hazard of back-of -the- envelope calculation). In fact the day of the low is 389 (not 399 as
I had punched into my calculator) days from the GE high on August 28, 2000 (not July

28, 2000 as you wrote below!). The square root of 388 is 19.723 which is on the 90 
degree angle, not the 135 degree angle. 
The price difference 60.75 high to 28.50 low is 32.25. Multiply this by 10 and you get 
322.5. Square root of this is 17.958 which is on the 135 degree angle as I said in the 
original post.
SO, the bottom line is that I SCREWED UP and the GE low did NOT square time in the 
manner which I originally claimed. Time was on the 90 degree angle while price was on 
the 135 degree angle.

I think the point I was trying to make in the paragraphs which preceded the one you 
quoted below in my post was this. The "secret", if it exists, couldn't possibly be found in 
print. No one who knew such a secret would have any possible reason to write about it or 
to explain it to anyone else for the reasons I cited.
I first saw a copy of the square of 9 in 1979. Billy Jones sent one to me in response to an 
inquiry of mine about Gann.
It took me many years to learn how to use this tool. The booklets I wrote about the square
of 9 in 1981-1982 had some interesting ideas but, like all things in print on the subject, 
they don't contain the key technique because I didn't know it then. If I had known it I 
wouldn't have written any booklets about it.
I make my assertions about what Gann knew for two reasons. First I can compare what I 
know to what Gann wrote about in his courses and books. Secondly, I observe that Gann 
was basically an astrologer and played the markets for himself using astrology as his 
basic tool. I can assure you that if he really knew how to apply the square of 9 he would 
never have needed to use financial astrology in the first place. 
Moreover, I personally don't believe that a man who knew the secret to the markets 
would, even in his late 60's and 70's, continue to sell courses and books to the public. I 
think he did this because it was easier for him to make money this way than to take it 
from the market.

I've noticed a lot of discussion on Gann's square of 9 so I thought that the group might 
enjoy learning a bit more about this chart.
The square of 9 is known in occult circles as the enneagram (from the Greek "enneas" 
meaning "nine"). I understand (second hand) that a certain Hindu guru (since deceased) 
asserted that whoever unravels the secrets of the enneagram " will enjoy riches and 
wealth and be sexually fertile".
From a mathematical point of view the square of 9 is just an ancient graphical method for
calculating square roots of numbers. As such it goes back thousands of years before 
Gann.
It is easy to write down an exact formula for the numbers in the enneagram which 
correspond to any given degree in the cycle of 360 degrees.
Suppose you want to figure out which numbers in the square of nine (the enne- agram) lie
on the angle of X degrees where X is any number between 0 and 360.
The answer is (2n + 5/4 + 2X/360 )squared. Here n is any whole number (e.g. 
0,1,2,3,4,...). 
This formula gives the cardinal and fixed points on the square of 9 as follows:
0 degrees: (2n + 5/4)squared
45 degrees: (2n + 6/4)squared
90 degrees: (2n + 7/4)squared

225 degrees: (2n + 2/4)squared
270 degrees: (2n + 3/4)squared

EXAMPLE 1: Suppose we want to calculate the numbers on the 225 degree angle. Using

above correspond to the numbers on the square of 9 chart if one places the number 0 in 
the central square and spirals out from there. 
In my opinion this is the most useful way to convert angles to numbers using the square 
of 9. It requires only a hand calculator with a square root and a square function.
It is silly to spend $$$ to purchase software or copies of the square of 9 when these 
calculations can be done so simply.
Hope this helps.

Hello Carl,
 
Thank you for accepting to answer some questions regarding your work publicly. I 
have 4 questions:
 
1. Do you have other work beside "The Principle of Squares"and " Predicting Market 
Trends With Periodic Number Cycles"
 
2. In the Principle of Squares, you have presented the method by squaring the "natural 
numbers", what about ratios such as 0.382, 0.618, 1.618,...? I found them also to be 
significant for time and price cycles.
 
135 degrees: (2n) squared 
180 degrees: (2n + 1/4)squared 
225 degrees: (2n + 2/4)squared 
270 degrees: (2n + 3/4)squared 
315 degrees: (2n + 1)squared. 
EXAMPLE 1: Suppose we want to calculate the numbers on the 225 degree angle. Using 
the formula above for n=1 we get (2x1 + 2/4)squared = 6.25. For n=2 we get (2x2 
+2/4)squared = 20.25. For n=3...etc. 
EXAMPLE 2: Suppose we want to calculate the numbers that correspond to 108 degrees. 
Substitute X = 108 in the first formula in this post. Then for n=1 we calculate (2x1 + 5/4 
+ 216/360)squared = (2 + 5/4 + 6/10)squared = 14.82. For n=2 we calculate (2x2 + 5/4 + 
216/360) squared = (4 + 5/4 + 6/10)squared = 34.22. 
Those of you who have a paper copy of the square of 9 will notice that the calculations

3. You have used different formula for time than the price formula, I use the same 
formula for price also for time by adding the natural numbers(or fib ratio) to the time then
resquare, this was able to predict Nasdaq bottom on 4/4/2001, My question: is there a 
reason for using different formula for price?
 
4. In "Predicting Market Trends With Periodic Number Cycles" you have presented 
several other methods, my question: how and when do you use these other methods you 
have mentioned, the point I am trying to reach: it is difficult to use all the methods you 
have mentioned because trader may have different projected days by using them all. 
Personally I use the price method you mentioned for both time and price as a part of the 
important things I always look at in making my decisions.

The answer to your first question is easy: the two booklets you mentioned are the only 
ones currently in print.
I'll answer the last three questions in this way.
When I wrote the "Principle of Squares" and "Predicting Market Trends..." twenty years 
ago I was convinced that predicting the timing of future highs and lows was the key to 
success in speculation.
About 70% of what I wrote in those two booklets concerns such "timing" methods.
But I eventually concluded that, at least for my own purposes, timing methods were too 
unreliable. I was interested in making trades at prices as close to the actual highs and 
lows as possible. Even a day's error in an S&P timing prediction would preclude making 
such an exact entry or exit.
So I began to focus solely on understanding support and resistance in price. I eventually 
concluded that the highs and lows of market swings do not occur at random prices but 
instead can be anticipated using, for example, the square of 9. Nowadays time 
calculations play no role in my market approach.
I might add that studying Gann put me on the path to understanding how the market 
really works. But I spent many years being confused by all the innumerable techniques 
one could use. This hindered my progress a great deal. The truth about markets only 
started to emerge from the mist after I abandoned all efforts to forecast the dates of future
highs and lows and instead focused on understanding why price swings stopped at the 
levels they did.

So my advice is simple: study support and resistance and forget timing forecasts. I know 
that most Gann aficionados will disagree with me, but then I never had much success 
doing things the way others thought they should be done.
Hope this helps.
Carl
Hello Carl,
Thank you for your reply, do you think that "understanding why price swings stopped at 
the levels they did." related to because "price" at certain levels has a relation to "time", 
for example, measured moves, balancing time and price, square of 9 when converting 
price and time to degrees..
Regards,
Haytham
No I don't.
There are many interesting coincidences where price extremes appear to be controlled by 
some sort of time count (as for example in some sort of squaring of price with time). But 
I myself have never found a method incorporating time counts that CONSISTENTLY 
detects such tops and bottoms.
In my opinion a useful trading method must be consistently accurate and simple to use. 
Otherwise a normal person won't be able to apply it successfully. 
I believe the truth about market is to be found in simple calculations. If you are doing 
something complicated, it probably won't work with enough consistency to enable you to 
follow it mechanically. 
Carl

I have studied and traded all the technical analysis methods from stochastic to RSI to 
Candlestick to everything out there, all works to a certain degree but not consistently, 
when I start studying "time" my performance improved significantly. 
I believe mass psychology reactions and counter reactions are repetitive(cyclical in 
nature)and if we know the vibration rate of specific market it will be easier to evaluate 
the importance of price level, vibration rate has a relation to time, even square of nine 
angles has a relation to time.

Haytham;
If your methods work for you why bother trying to improve them or find better ones? 
After all, the name of this game is to make money from the market, not to show the world
how smart we are. 
I think a good trader is like a good athlete or a good gambler. 
Barry Bonds can't tell you which pitches he will hit out of the park before the game starts.
He isn't interested in prediction. He is a great player because he REACTS 
APPROPRIATELY to the CURRENT SITUATION, not because he can forecast the 
sequence of pitches he will see or their location in the strike zone. 
A good blackjack player can't tell you before he sits down at the table just which hands 
he will be dealt or whether he will win or loose that day. But he succeeds because he 
REACTS APPROPRIATELY to the hand he holds.
So it is with trading. I calculate support and resistance by measuring from historical highs
and lows and using the square of 9 to covert prices into degrees. When the market 
reaches forecast support or resistance I will fade it if the main trend is in the opposite 
direction. Otherwise I will look for some indication on my hourly charts that support or 
resistance is actually working. That's all there is to it.
I should say that when I first learned about Gann 20 years ago I tried something similar 
but couldn't make it work for me. Part of the reason was that I didn't understand the 
significance of the various angles and consequently didn't calculate correctly. But the 
other reason was that I was so enamoured with the idea of predicting the times when 
trend changes were due that I overlooked phenomena which were in fact staring me in the
face. So many wasted years!

Haytham:
This is a postscript to my last response to your response to....
My own trading education followed a course similar to the one you described.
First I learned all the techniques of standard technical analysis. 
Then I learned astrology and Gann. I found that incorporating the time element did 
indeed improve the performance of the standard technical methods.
But I found that my performance was not consistent. I would go through winning streaks,
and then loosing streaks of small losses but many of them. Even more aggravating was 
the problem of missing big swings that my timing methods just didn't see. So finally I 
resolved to apply the "180 degree" principle and do the opposite of what I had been 
doing. So I abandoned standard technical methods, cycles, and 99% of the stuff I learned 
from studying Gann. Instead I focused only on price support and resistance.
I remember some correspondence I had back then with a professional trader who had 
been a member of the CBOT and many other exchanges. I explained some of my timing 
methods and as an aside mentioned that I did a little work with support and resistance 
levels. He responded by saying "If you understand how to calculate support and 
resistance correctly what more do you need?" He was right. I only wish I had paid more 
attention at the time!

In your instructions for converting price to degrees, we students are instructed to divide 
the price by 0.0055555....   
Rather than going through this exercise in division, I find it much easier to just 
multiply the price by 180º.  This I can do in my head, whereas I don't have enough of the 
'little gray cells' to do the division in my head.  What do you think? 
I know you are getting a lot of praise for your generous sharing of your knowledge of 
Gann and astro, but, hey, you deserve it!  Thanks again!

When you first started posting here, someone asked you where the 0.0055555 
you were using came from.  Another answered that it was the reciprocal of 180º. 
You agreed that was true. 
Therefore: 
Price / 0.0055555 is mathematically the same as 
Price / (1/180º) = 
Price x 180º 
I just noticed that by multiplying by 180º not only was easier for me, but that this also 
eliminated the rounding error; i.e., 180º is exact!

Means you make the program calculate time between last reversal and coming, convert it 
to degree and calculate price on sq9. So you don't have to do it by hand old fashioned 
way or even think about it, it just pops on the screen next to time reversal indicator as a

No Gann labels, no bs.

DJIA 11750 high - 8062 low = 3688 points. It's not a cardinal, corner or natural square. 
But divide 3688 by 11750. It comes out to .3138 or .0001 from a corner
number on the Sq. of 9.
Further, 1/14/00 high to 3/22/01 low (9106) is 434 days and 2644 points. Divide the

495 days separates the high from the 5/22/01 price of 11350, another high. The 
difference, obviously, is 400 points, a natural square. 495 is one point away from a
180 degree cardinal number of 496. Meanwhile, 400 is one degree from the 
sesquiquadrate angle on the Sq. of 9, meaning time and price move were a semisquare 
apart.
From the 3/22 low to the 5/22 high is 62 days. From the 5/22 high to 9/21 low, 123 days; 
time doubled.

According to my calculator, 60.75 squared =3690.56. Doesn't this mean that 3688 is on 
the cardinal angle of 270 degrees in the square of 9? I might also point out that 
September 18 (3 days prior to the low) was 24.75 squared days from the Dow high at 
11750 on January 14, 2000. Thus time and price were conjunct on the 270 degree angle at
the Dow low.
Unhappy experience has taught me to keep calculations as simple as possible. A toolkit

Sorry, I made a small error.
The price of 8055 is 89.75 squared which is on the 90 degree angle from 0 (not the 270

In June 2002 Eurodollar, there is a mathematical relationship based on time and price 
between the contract low and the high posted today.
 
Time : 29 rounds of helio Mercury.
Price: 7.5 cycle from 90.930 low to today's 97.720 high converting price to rate then 
using square of 9.
 
Fundamentally speaking, most of the economic numbers this month have been very weak
reflecting the Sept. 11th incident. Although, the economy has shown no sign of recovery 
any time soon, the economic weakness of this magnitude is a bit over done. As a result, 
short end is vulnerable to any economic number that shows unusual weakness in 
expectation that the number will come back to more modest decline after the incident.
 
Still, the overall position of long the short end and short the long end to take advantage of
the yield curve steepening from FED easing has been the major play up to now.  Once, the
sign of further weakness in the short end is confirmed, in tandem, expect  buy back of 
short position in the long end. This should keep the long end to retain value despite the 
weakness in the short end which means
the yield curve should flatten for the time being.

One of the main reasons I joined this list was to help people avoid the many wrong turns I
made in my life-long quest to understand how markets really work.
With this in mind I thought there might be some interest in a brief history of my efforts to
come to terms with Gann and his legacy.
My first encounter with W.D. Gann occurred in 1966 in the stacks of a university library. 
There I found bound volumes of the Ticker Magazine (later renamed the Magazine of 
Wall Street). Paging through the 1909 volume I found the now famous article on W. D. 
Gann which recounted his trading successes of that year.
My reaction was the same as yours: initial amazement followed by a determination to 
figure out just how Gann did it.

I had no success until 1977 when I saw an ad for an annual stock market forecast put out 
by Lambert-Gann Publishing. At the same time I had read a book by R.E. McMaster 
entitled "Cycles of War". 
In one chapter of his book McMaster recounted Gann's story (and started the myth that 
Gann made $50 million). I wrote to McMaster about Gann. He wrote back saying that he 
had studied Gann’s commodity course but didn't understand much of it. He added that 
much of Gann's work was based on astrology.
I then decided to study astrology which I did extensively for 8 years. I first met Norman 
Winski in 1980 in New Orleans and he was very helpful to me in many ways. Never one 
to leave a stone unturned, I also obtained photocopies of many manuscripts published in 
Latin by European and Arabic astrologers (Bonatus, Morinus, Abu Mashar, Placidus, 
Masha Aallah to name a few- my 4 years of high school Latin came in handy here).
At the time I was publishing a stock and commodity forecasting letter, The Cyclic 
Forecast. My principal technique for long range forecasting was astrology (although I 
didn't tell my readers this), but shorter range forecasts were based on other Gann 
techniques (more on this later).
After eight years of extensive experience with astrological forecasting I reached some 
conclusions. 
First, astrology has value- it is not a hoax as some would have it. 
But my interest was not in assessing the scientific merits of astrology; it was in 
forecasting and trading markets. 
A realistic evaluation of my own experience in astrological market forecasting led me to 
my second conclusion. Astrological forecasting was not consistently accurate enough for 
my purposes. Remember, I spent 8 long years of extensive study and practice in real 
markets before I reached this conclusion. To make astrology a useful tool in markets you 
have to combine it with other things, usually some form of technical analysis. Once you 
start doing this it is hard to see just what added value the astrological forecast gives you.
One can argue of course that I just didn't do astrology right. 
Certainly this is a possibility. But one should consider also the experiences of the many 
brilliant men and women who have studied and practiced astrology through the ages and 
in modern times. If astrology were the key to the markets one would think that at least of 
few would have become market legends. But, as far as I can determine, no astrologer has 
become famous for his or her trading or investing prowess. The single exception to this 
rule is W. D. Gann and, as member of this list know, I have serious doubts about him too.
I had no success until 1977 when I saw an ad for an annual stock market forecast put out 
by Lambert-Gann Publishing. At the same time I had read a book by R.E. McMaster 
entitled "Cycles of War". 
In one chapter of his book McMaster recounted Gann's story (and started the myth that 
Gann made $50 million). I wrote to McMaster about Gann. He wrote back saying that he 
had studied Gann’s commodity course but didn't understand much of it. He added that 
much of Gann's work was based on astrology. 
I then decided to study astrology which I did extensively for 8 years. I first met Norman 
Winski in 1980 in New Orleans and he was very helpful to me in many ways. Never one 
to leave a stone unturned, I also obtained photocopies of many manuscripts published in 
Latin by European and Arabic astrologers (Bonatus, Morinus, Abu Mashar, Placidus, 
Masha A

So if astrology wasn't the answer what was? Back in New Orleans in 1980 where I met 
Norman Winski I also met Phyllis Kahn, a charming and very smart lady who has written
many articles on Gann, has much practical experience applying Gann to markets, and still
puts out a newsletter, Gann Angles. 
I asked Phyllis if it was worthwhile purchasing Gann's commodity course then published 
by Lambert-Gann. She responded with an emphatic yes. This was the turning point in my
market career.
I studied the commodity course and came away with three main ideas. 
First was the basic idea that trend changes occurred when price squared time (whatever 
this meant!). Second was the technique of geometric angles, especially the 1x1 angle and 
especially the angles from the price of 0 which start at the time of a major high or low. 
Finally, and most important, was the square of 9 (or the octagon chart as I liked to call it 
at the time).
In my market letter I used all of these ideas ( plus my astrological forecasts) to predict 
highs and lows in stocks and commodities and to identify the direction of the main trend. 
I had many successes and my share of failures too.
I shut down the letter in 1983 and went off on my own to trade and manage money. Here 
too I had some successes and some failures.
For a time I even abandoned Gann ideas in my market work completely. But one very 
peculiar and fortunate event had occurred in 1981 and it kept me returning to my old 
Gann work periodically, wondering whether I had missed something.
While still publishing the Cyclic Forecast I wrote my two booklets, "The Principle of 
Squares" and “Predicting Market Trends with Periodic Number Cycles". One of my 
subscribers wrote to me after reading "The Principle of Squares" and asserted that the 
market was an exact mathematical science. He said that Gann knew only one true thing 
and hinted that it was related to the Square of 9 (I didn't catch this hint until a number of 
years later). He asserted that all other Gann techniques worked only some of the time and
were not effective enough to rely upon in trading. 
Since this man had been a member of the Board of Trade as well as a number of foreign 
exchanges he had some credibility with me. It took me many years before I understood 
what he had only hinted at.
Meantime I had been experimenting again with techniques for squaring price with time. I 
was measuring price using the harmonics of 360 ( Gann students call this the square of 
90). I was close to what I now understand to be the key to the markets but was using the 
wrong tool.
So if astrology wasn't the answer what was? Back in New Orleans in 1980 where I met 
Norman Winski I also met Phyllis Kahn, a charming and very smart lady who has written 
many articles on Gann, has much practical experience applying Gann to markets, and still

Then I again got sidetracked and started to study planetary support and resistance. This I 
did for several years. I concluded that this method has value, but it doesn't tell you what 
you really need to know: just how big a reversal should one expect once a support or 
resistance level is hit.
Finally, after these many detours I returned to my first love, the Square of 9. One day I 
was sitting at my desk mulling over my history of working with Gann ideas. A flash of 
inspiration led me to look at a recent market extreme to see whether it showed a squaring 
of price with time using the square of 9. It did and that started 
me on the road to developing the method I use today.
The problem with Gann is that there are many "doors" to choose from. Each one opens 
onto a path of study which can take many years. Yet I think that only one door leads to 
the truth about market. All the others lead to techniques which work only some of the 
time and are not reliable enough to trade with.
I know most people on this list have commitments to this or that Gann technique. But if 
you choose badly you will search many years and never get where you want to go.
I hope my own story will serve as a warning and as a cautionary tale.

HI CARL
I have read ur story with great interest.
For some reasons I cud not respond to it b4 now.
U made following statement :
>>>>Astrological forecasting was not consistently accurate enough for my purposes....To
make astrology a useful tool in markets you have to combine it with other things, usually 
some form of technical analysis.
>>>
I think that goes for Mr Gann too.
In his yearly forecasts he had a tendency to expect turns within a short time-frame of 
some 2-3 days. If u check some of them u will find that sometimes his time-frame was set
even wider. The reason for this is that the forecasting method which I believe Gann used 
was not at all accurate all the time despite the fact that he also averaged the cycle turns to 
get what he called a vibration point.
Then I again got sidetracked and started to study planetary support and resistance. This I 
did for several years. I concluded that this method has value, but it doesn't tell you what 
you really need to know: just how big a reversal should one expect once a support or 
resistance level is hit.

These vibration points he used as guideline for his yearly forecasts. He then zoomed it in 
later when using his key cycle for shorter term action as described in one of his books 
(TTTA) Even the short term cycle sometimes gives u a headache when deciding what the
key vibration point shud be. 
One good example is the current action in may wheat/2002 contract.
If the market hasn't made an inversion (which occur from time to time) since dec 13/2001
low we have likely seen a dec 28 top. The problem is that the vibration top dec 28 was 
very early. Best wud have been a dec 31st high.
Now we are already talking jan 2nd and if the cycle is overdue we have a possibility to 
endure the cycle top until 2morrow.
As u can see that is a very wide range tho it is not at all uncommon that the vibration 
point comes in at a slightly lower top (or higher low). 
So I agree with u that following strictly astrological timing must be used with utmost care
to which u may add tech. analysis.
In fact Gann himself in his 1921 book "Truth of the Stock tape" wrote 
: " I am considered an expert tape reader"...Yes, one statement went even further using 
the expression "intuitive tape reading “ 
I believe he knew what he was talking about as he knew that his astrological method 
sometimes cud be slightly off. Of course that is why he also put so much emphasis on 
stop losses in his writing.
For those who may have an interest in May wheat it shud follow the downside when the 
last minor swing low has been broken or even today's low. Assuming that we have not 
made an inversion I believe that is the next direction of wheat.
The next cycle low shud come in around jan 16. 
From there it shud go up until jan 28 before a reaction shud take us well into feb or the 
11. The next top after this shud be around feb 18/2002. 
These dates serve as guideline in the forecast just the way I believe they did for mr. 
Gann.( I have not worked out the exact short term action points for confirmation)
Funny enough many of the dates mentioned coincide well with new and full moon dates. 
This is not always the case but when they do it may add further confidence to a forecast. 
Some readers may see that the moon set up in this case may be opposite of what 
suggested by Burton Pugh.
Finally Carl: Im not so sure that only one door leads to the truth about markets. 
However ...if that door is cyclic repetition I do agree but remember that he also advised 
us to follow "all" of his rules "all" the time. 
I don't think he meant "all" tho !
I prefer to use some of the key cycles as he mentioned specifically in Tunnel for 
confirmation. 
Tks for writing.
These vibration points he used as guideline for his yearly forecasts. He then zoomed it in

Yes u are rite.
In fact May wheat did make an inversion late dec.01
The base wud therefore be that dec 31st actually was the turn date for the low despite a 
slightly higher one. It was a difficult set up I admit as described in my earlier mail. The 
forecast called for the next turn to be around jan16. An average of previous med-term 
cycles I have tested in fact prefer jan 17 as best for a top. 
Jan 28 shud then turn out to be a low while the feb 11 shud be a high. 
In fact rechecking this last one...a feb 14 maybe 15th wud be a better turn date for this 
particular high. 
Feb 19/20 shud be very important for May wheat.
In fact the whole period feb 14 - feb 21 is very important.
The forecast calls for an important move of considerable time and possible also in price 
to follow when this period has passed.
Speaking of prices I am only able to give u a few points that I have worked out so far. U 
may take it for what it is as the working out of percentages is something I still need to do 
more work on.
Well here goes.
The current move shud end ideally at 311...hope to see that completed 2morrow or the 
day after. U may have noticed that we saw 309 1/2 on the 14th.
A low on jan 28 has a price target of 291 1/2 in may wheat while the feb 14 high 
indicates 323. 
I hope this helps tho I warn u that futures trading is a risky business.
Have a great day.
Allan
Yes, I believe May wheat is running out of time to the downside. After the top in mid jan 
the forecast was down to jan 28 for a low of 291 1/2. We saw 288 1/2 today and I take 
that on account of lost motion.
The cycle is now 2 days overdue according to what I believe was the yearly forecast 
cycle Gann used in his days.. As I have pointed out b4 it can vary slightly from its 
vibrational mean despite methods available that may zoom it in.
I believe a move of some 30 cents is waiting for us on the upside in may wheat as the 
next vibration mean is feb 14 or 15 for a price of 320 1/4 which is a few points below my 
original forecast of 323.
U have asked me how I use percentages.
Unfortunately I can only give u one clue which is much importance tho.

On page 32 in "Profits in Commodities " Gann wrote : " You must apply time cycles and 
time rules in connection with figuring percentages on the bottom"...and I will add also to 
tops as just above this passage he wrote : "each top or bottom…. comes out in accordance
with an exact mathematical proportion to some other top or bottom"
As u may be aware of most people use percentages from any top or bottom that may add 
up to something. In this case Gann tells us to use specific tops and bottoms according to 
the time cycle....That is a great difference. 
When that is done, and only then u may add up percentages from other tops and bottoms 
of importance. I guess it shud not be hard tho to find many confirmations in doing so.
In addition to this I use the sq9 and the "master 360 price and time chart" to find 
confirming angles to my forecasted price.
I believe it wud also be helpful to look at planetary lines tho Im very careful not to rely 
too much upon them.
I still work hard to improve the percentages work Im doing in order to make them better 
and better. The set up can sometimes be disturbing on account of lost motion. Best in 
those cases is to get confirmation from other contracts like wheat december which I use a 
lot.
I will update again in mid feb as I know u pay attention.

Thanks Carl.  I've been tinkering around with calculations, but wasn't hitting the numbers
you posted, so I wondered whether it was a contract difference, e.g front month high was 
112-19, while USH2 high was 111-17.   I keep front month charts for weekly and 
monthly, but , like you, dial down to the current contract month for daily swings.   
Unfortunately, this means that its my methodology, not contract choice, that's creating the
difference!
 
FWIW - using 4 ticks/day as a measurement, the 50% level on the square of 144 price-
wise is also 98.  The top of 144 is 107 which was significant resistance in Jan. and March
of this year, and 111 1/2 was 1.25 X 144 (missed the high price, but high close on USZ 
was 111 1/2), so it has been worthwhile to follow.
 
Thanks for your posts.

Your levels seem to be holding for now.   I am curious - are your calculations based on 
the March contracts or continuous front month contracts?   Or doesn't it matter because 
you're working on ticks travelled rather than absolute prices?

Greg:
The answer to your question is a bit complicated. I could't give you a complete answer 
without explaining details of my calculations which I prefer to keep to myself. 
However, I will explain the general guidelines I use. For longer term work (intermediate 
term trends and major trends) I usually use continuation contract numbers while for 
shorter term work the current contract extremes.
If by continuous contracts you mean those which are weighted averages of two or more 
nearby contracts, just let me say that I have never found these useful for my calculations.

Being British my knowledge of American history is sketchy to say the least  but as I 
understand it the war of independence started because of the taxes imposed by king 
George to pay for the war against the French.
This is a naive piece of propaganda imo and the continuance of slavery was closer to the 
hearts of Benjamin Franklin and others who were wary of British politicians who wished 
to dispense with it.
To illustrate the conspiracy it is interesting to note that the war against France was 
actually triggered by the shooting of French civilian prisoners by British troops. However
the officer who ordered the shooting, and I have no doubt he knew what would become 
of it, was none other than George Washington himself who was a serving officer in the 
British Army at the time.  
George Washington was a freemason, so was Benjamin Franklin but their connections 
run deeper than just simple  freemasonry. Franklin was a member of the hellfire club with

links through its founder to esoteric societies, the Templars and the Illuminati. The 
illuminati funded Rosicrucian and Freemason lodges in Germany and elsewhere.
The 'poor' knights Templar saved Scotland from defeat by England when a troop of their 
knights arrived on the battle field at Bannockburn at just the right moment to save the 
Scots who were being hard pressed. This troop of knights appears to have 2 years 
previously fled papal persecution in the Languedoc region of France in the Templars own
private navy to Scotland, which was not under papal domination at the time. Eventually 
their stay was an embarrassment to the Scots and they faded out of sight thereafter. Its 
possible the Templar's navy went to America in the 1300s and took many of the knights 
with them. It is rumoured that one St Clair family member went to America about that 
time. The St Clairs (Sinclairs) were/are heavily involved in these mysteries all the way 
back to the excavations of Solomons temple after the first crusade.
The Templars were far from poor. They effectively created an international banking 
system and accumulated absolutely vast wealth. It was this wealth that made the French 
king seek papal authority to persecute the Templars. The excuse was the gnostic heresy. 
Unfortunately for him all the treasure disappeared before he could get his greedy fingers 
on it. The Templars had paid spies and sympathisers  everywhere including inside the 
Vatican and were tipped off about Simon de Montford's plans.
The game that is being played is a very long one indeed, so long it stretches into the pre 
christian era, even before the time of Osiris.
Astrologers have always wielded great power and influence. One example of this was the
astrologer to the King Raja Raja who persuaded  him to build thousands of temples in 
southern India. This particular astrologer may have been one of the seven sages as it 
appears he was instrumental in ordering an expedition to build the temple of Angor Wat 
in Cambodia. This temple is connected with the pyramid at Giseh and others including 
one now subterranean just off the shores of Easter island which all lie on particular 
longitudes around the world.
I believe this society of sages with its power and influence over the millennia has 
spawned a myriad of other organisations, including the Royal Society? the Bildeburg 
group? which themselves have no idea of the true end game. These astrologers with a 
vast knowledge gleaned from 40,000 years of stargazing, observing  and manipulating 
human events have accumulated vast wealth and are well placed to take advantage of 
todays electronic systems to control and manipulate the worlds markets.
They also spread disinformation and are always represented on both sides in any conflict 
so that no matter who loses they are always on the winning side. For example, Mao Tse 
Tung was a master freemason so  were Santa Anna and Huston.
There is a long game imo and we are all potential victims of it.
(btw nothing I say should be taken too seriously)

Hello everyone,
 
I don't regularly do the ellipse analysis (I'm lazy) but when you do it I think it quite often 
reveals the underlying cycles visually.  I find it to be very useful when you are in doubt or
unsure of any cycle (astro or geometry) change that  is about to take place. If you look at 
the chart, I think you can see that the ellipse can work together with many other tools.  I 
used Excel 2000's built in auto shape function. I used to use Adobe Illustrator and it can 
do a lot of 2 dimensional ratio analysis and overlay all kinds of shapes to a chart but  it 
wasn't user friendly (after all it is an illustration software!). Unfortunately, the Excel 97 
doesn't have this function of ellipse that let you tilt the axis, only Excel 2000 does, so be 
careful. I think when you are at a critical  stage of making trading decision based on 
cycles, this analysis might help to fine tune your trading strategy. The basic concept came
from Brad Cowan and George Bayer's ellipse analysis but this one has been drawn totally
by my eyes and feel. No math. In my opinion eyeball and feel works just as good as 
anything. This is an ongoing development of just another type of market analysis and I 
am in no way an expert. So please tell me if there are any improvements that can be 
made to the technique or any  opinion is welcomed.
 
Best regards, Utaro Hayashi
Utaro,
Thank you for sharing this with us, I find your post very interesting because you are able 
to "rotate" the ellipse to fit chart, I know ellipse method is "very" important, in fact 
George Bayer described it as "the most important method shown in this book". 
What has prevented me from doing further research on ellipse using Bayer work is the 
"scale" problem, George used chart paper made by Keuffel & Esser of New York, this is 
not exist anymore(I think) and he did not talk about the scale when he describe the 
dimension of the ellipse.
I would highly appreciate if you share with us how did you use excel 2000 to generate 
ellipse and what software did you use to draw this picture and ellipses.

My method is simple: I watch the days  of these vertical lines and mid point between 2

6/29 @98 solar degree is 99 days from 3/22.
proprietary methods based on astro analysis. The vertical line represent days projected 
into the future for potential turning point. 
My method is simple: I watch the days of these vertical lines and mid point between 2 
vertical lines for reversal using 60 min bars, MACD, RSI, volume and candlesticks, I 
increase my accuracy by using bar count, measured move, square of nine and other 
squares, Gann angles,...

Hello Seymour,

Now you know why. According to Gann it is sort of Rosa Christian superstition. 
According to Vedas it is moon trine exaltation  cycle to the stars. If you

This business of subtracting 225 after multiplying the square root by 180 seems to cause 
endless confusion.
But there is really nothing mysterious about it.
The point of subtracting 225 is to put the squares of even numbers on the 135 degree 
angle and the squares of odd numbers on the 315 degree angle. If you didn't subtract 225 
you would find, for example, that the number 16 (square of 4) would be on the 0 degree 
angle (instead of on the 135 where it belongs).   Similarly, if you don't subtract 225 you 
will put the number 25 (square of 5) on the 180 degree angle 
(instead of on the 315 where it belongs.
I've never had any success interpreting the numbers in the square of 9 as percentages.

Guys,
I need your help with some simple maths.
Michael Jenkins in one of his book; say's that when drawing the following angles on a 
chart, you are infact drawing the divisions of price and not angles:
90/2=45
45/2=22.5
22.5/2=5.625
He says that half of a 45 Degree angle is an angle of 26.75 degrees 
and not 22.5 degrees.
Also it is the natural square of 10 from major low for nasdaq on 4/4/2001 and end of

In fact Gann protractors have the 26.75* line.
Can anyone explain the rational behind this in laymans terms please.
Ron
This is just a matter of high school trigonometry.
Gann trend lines are drawn by choosing a starting point and then 
moving to the right by N units of time and then up(or down) by K units of price.
Let's call the number N the "run" and the number K the "rise" (or the "fall" if the 
trendline slopes downward).
In Gann theory we usually have the ratio of the "rise" to the "run", 
i.e. the number K/N, as some power of two. 
For example, a trendline that slopes upward might have the "run" be 1 and the "rise" be 
equal to 2. This is what I call a 2 x 1 angle. It slopes upward 2 units of price for every 1 
unit of time. So the number K/N in this example is 2. 
As another example, the "run" is 2 and the "rise" is 1. This is a trendline that is the Gann 
1 x 2 angle, it slopes upward 1 unit of price for every 2 units of time. So the number K/N 
in this example is 1/2. 
Now suppose we want to measure these trendlines by the trigonometric 
angles they make with respect to any horizontal line. In other words, 
we want to measure them with a protractor.
What trigonometric angle will the protractor measure?
From high school trigonometry we know that the TANGENT of any angle 
is the given by the "rise" divided by the "run" of the sloping line 
defined by the angle. (Here the TANGENT is a mathematical function 
which you can find on your calculator by looking for the TAN key.)
So we know that our number K/N is the TANGENT of an unknown angle. 
To find this unknown angle look for the ARCTAN or TAN^(-1) key on 
your calculator. Then key in our number K/N and then press the ARCTAN 
key. The answer will be in degrees. So you will find that for the 1 
x 2 angle, K/N = 1/2 and ARCTAN (1/2)is 26.565 degrees as desired.

Hi Ron,
 
Hope you don't mind my butting in here but... you can find the answer to that question in 
PD Osupensky's In Search of the Miraculous (which is  on Gann's reading list) Chapter 7 
where we talks about Octaves.   One octave up is x2 one octave down is X1/2 etc.
 
Also here is a little memory tool Mrs. Burns taught me years ago:
 
Oscar => Opposite

Has    => Hypotenuse
 
A        => Adjacent
-------------------------------        COSINE

Hi folks,

look at the contruction of Gann's Sq09, so that everybody
is starting on the same page .....  
Firstly, Sq09 is simply a primitive square root calculator, if
we start with 1 in the centre and use a 9 x 9 = 81 square
Yes, we can use significant highs or lows, like 13032003 low, 
but in that way, we should be using it a little differently, as
we must also consider some longer time cycles, in the

complete, in the sense that he used many different overlays
to align price, time and geometry.
Technically, many Sq09 charts are inverted in their 
construction, but it does not matter, until it comes time
to marry price and time together, with the planetary
overlays.
From 1, the count should be to the left for 2, then in
anti-clockwise mode for the rest of the count to 81.
Now, if you look at the chart, there should be a vertical and 
horizontal lines across the centre, this is the Cardinal Cross 
and represents one season of solar movement or 90 degrees 
on a 360 degree dial.
That is, Gann's trading year started on March equinox,
represented by the horizontal axis and marked on the
left-hand side of your square ..... from there, every
90 degrees of solar movement finds a solstice or an
equinox, on the Cardinal Cross.
Next, we have another cross shown across the diagonals
of the square chart, known as the Fixed Cross.
Both crosses serve as support and resistance for the price
as it approaches each level, targetted by the crosses.
This also divides the circle into 8 x 45 degree segments,
just as Gann divided the RANGE of market moves by 8
to establish common support and resistance levels, as 
used in Murrey Maths, etc.

So, the daily increment commonly used is a step of 1 ... that
represents markets that move about one cent or dollar per

For markets that move more than 1 unit/day, we adjust the
step-up to the appropriate value ..... you can find a list of
these for many commodity markets, in some Gann-related
books.

Plotting the geometric positions of the plannets as they 
rotate through the wheel allows us to pinpoint where an 
opposition or grand trine alignment will occur at a particular 
time in the future . Gann talked about live angles which is 
where the longitude of the major plannets came into square 
trine or opposition points on the 360 deg wheel . Certain 
major opposition points could have a higher electromagnetic 
influence as compared to smaller scale plannets in opposition
so the question of individual correlation is a difficult one to 
estimate . A commodity might respond more consistently and
have larger scale long lasting movements when say two of 
the major plannets align 180 deg . If we break this down 
further how can I establish ( calculate ) the timing componet 
( approx ) when these two majors will be in 180 opposition . 
The two plannets could move into opposition on the 1st jan 
2005 and as the opposition continues these two plannets 
might not reach exact opposition till 15th jan and then fade 
out of opposition on the 20th . so there is a timing window 
which is in direct proportion to the scale and speed of the 
plannets orbit . 
Using this long time window to position into any given 
instrument seems like a difficult task and as the plannetary 
tables are accurate we have no problem there but accurately 
co ordinating this imformation to position yourself at a low or
a cntr trend move has me a bit perplexed . 
In an idealised situation we might find that our commodity 
exhausts into low and turns trend on the 15th jan ( 180 deg 
point ) which would provide us with a clear indication to 
position long .

Using this long time window to position into any given 
instrument seems like a difficult task and as the plannetary 
tables are accurate we have no problem there but accurately 
co ordinating this imformation to position yourself at a low or 
a cntr trend move has me a bit perplexed . 
In an idealised situation we might find that our commodity 
exhausts into low and turns trend on the 15th jan ( 180 deg 
point ) which would provide us with a clear indication to 
position long .

This cycle could also be confirmed further by two minor 
plannets moving into aspect ( merc mars 126 deg 
respectively ) . 
But what happens if the trend continues down into the 20th 
day which is at the tail end of the opposition and then starts 
to turn up as the cycle fades and loses its influence . I can 
appreciate that the major astronomical alignments do take 
time to setup and move into exact alignment but from a 
timing perspective there is a large window and the trend 
could turn at any point within the cycle . there are wheels 
within wheels and within this primary opposition a faster 
moving planet might intersect the 180 deg point or a cluster 
of plannets might move into conjunction which could be the 
trigger and turn trend mid way or 3/4 through the cycle . 
I need to spend alot of time with this stuff , not esoteric 
dribble , it is too open to interpretation and unscientific . on 
the other hand smaller oppositions can take place within the 
wheel involving smaller planets , I guess it is all relative , you
might have the moon square jupiter and this cycle might only
run 2 days with excat opposition point occuring and fading 
rather quickly compared to our last example . 
It is very difficult to establish a precise link between the 
geometrical position of the planets and their directional 
influence on price . Each instrument has a set of unique 
properties that defines its molecular makeup . Lets take NAB

see the exact planetary degree , house and astrological 
ascendant on that date .

Numerology to code the names down to single digit ( Tokyo J

saturn and uranus will turn trend on all gold stocks because 
uranus is the primary controller of gold and is located 20 deg

longitude to the signature properties of that instrument . 
Markets expand and contract at different points on the

increased magnetic frequency between these planets might 
affect a broad range of instruments across several

The close conjunction between mercury 144 deg venus 145 
deg and saturn 147 deg trine pluto looks interesting . these 
three conjunctions are in leo and in some situations market 
major mkt lows seem to occur when three or more planets 
are in conjunction under one sign , this cant be statistically 
proven of course but it is just a general observation from 
what I have studied so far . 
The major low came out on the 16th so I dont think we could
really draw a precise correlation between the point of the low
and the exact degree between the opposition as they were 
several days apart , the strongest point of the opposition was
the 22nd and the low came in on the 16th so from a timing 
perspective it would be hard to to say that the opposition 
was the primary trigger to turn trend up due to the timing 
discrepancy . 
Jupiter was in Sagitarius at this point which is the sign 
equivalent but this line of information is sketchy and doesn't 
really provide us with any tangible information to base our 
decision on . 
Conjunction trine Pluto does look strong with the three 
planets in close aspect . breaking this down further we can 
see the first two planets to form conjunction were Venus and 
saturn on 1382007 and then our fast moving planet mercury 
88 days came into alignment with venus and saturn on the 
16th which marked the low which might indicate that when a 
fast plannet comes into alignment with two larger plannets of
the same degree it could serve as a directional trigger on 
certain stocks , I dont know , this has been discussed on may
beans so there might be something there ?
I guess there are several ways to use this information and

estimates projected risk on each trade and how I can exit 
that position if the market doesnt conform to my measures 
and principles . perhaps this is due to gaps within my 
knowledge base or lack of understanding certain sections , 
but sometimes I just sit back and wonder how Gann was able
to consistently prognosticate nearly every turning point 
within the wheat or beans market before that physical 
movement actually took place with such a high degree of 
accuracy .
Gann said that all market movements occur as the result of a
Natural Law and the Cause exists long before the Effect takes
place and if we can identify and understand how those forces
will exert themselves upon the market or a particular 
commodity then we can begin to build a conceptual 
framework into how these deterministic laws prevail and 
exert themselves upon certain instruments at a particular 
point in time . If we have the appropriate knowledge and 
information before us then we should be able to predict or 
estimate how this force or field of electromagnetic energy will
impact the instrument under observation and whether it will 
have a positive or negative impact .
Being able to consistently predict accurate turning points 
within the soybean market or The FTSE is really only one part
of the equation . Lets look at the Top on Lumber 27th 
December 316 1/4 . On this date certain Timing influences 
moved into directional alignment and cumulatively exerted 
their line of influence on the Lumber Market so for an astute 
observer who is trained in the principles of Natural Law he 
was able to interpret this information and apply it to the 
movement in Lumber but these Laws are universal and can 
mostly be applied to almost anything , but picking the Top is 
only a small component within the overall trade . how strong 
is the influence and how far in time can we expect this 
estimates projected risk on each trade and how I can exit 
that position if the market doesnt conform to my measures

beacause a stock has a historical tendency to turn trend 
every 30 days doesnt neccesarily mean that it is an absolute 
timing mechanism because you are really only observing the 
effect and therefore you are only seeing one side of the 
equation without developing an understanding into the 
underlying principles and force structures that actually cause 
the market to change trend at that given point in time .
This is what Gann was doing , he was studying and 
projecting forward timing points in wheat or corn based on a 
detailed examination of causes , the cause exists long before 
the effect takes place and it is just as easy to go forward 30 
days or one year and look for symetrical alignment between 
timing and price co ordinates but gee it is hard . it is akin to 
looking at the face of a watch and you can see the minute 
and hourly hands and the seconds ticking past but as the 
watch is a closed mechanism you cant see or understand the 
timing mechanics unless you take the case off the watch and 
peer inside and then we can truly identify and understand the
magnetics or revoultions that really create time . 
Just because Corn is 90 days from low to high doesnt 
necesarily constitute a change in trend although this is one 
quarter of the earths revolution and sometimes important 
timing points to co incide with winter or summer equinox 
points . The proportionate parts of the circle are an important
timing mechanism and when multiple civil time frames move 
into directional alignment it is an important place to look for 
a possible change in trend but still we are not investigating 
the natural principles of cause that determine prices to top 
and bottom and Gann did leave clues and imformation on 
how he applied these elements but its a long and tedious 
process to fit the pieces togethor and if you think it is more

I have been studying Gann rules for some time and am confused with 
one particular Gann calculation maybe someone could help clarify.
...and I quote from his letters...
"Example: Dec 2, 1953, May Soybeans high 311-1/4. This equaled 18 
degrees 45' in Pisces."
Would this not be 18 Degrees 45' prior to Pisces? 18 Degrees 45' in 
Pisces is 348.75 degrees.
He goes further to say "... or 90 degrees of Jupiter" Since Jupiter is 82.85 Geo and 80.46 
Helio, squaring the 348.75 to the Jupiter Helio is within a 2 Deg orb.
appreciate any advice.

I know the answer to this question because it is covered in Mr. Ferrera's "Gann Unveiled

If you just read Gann's work you will find all the answers....there are no real secrets. Take
the S & P 500 cash index.......Major low 1st week January 1950 at 16.65.......March 24th 
2000 All time High.........Helio Jupiter moved 1531 * (degrees) plus 16 gives 1547, 
Saturn Helio moved 614*....at 2.5 points per degree gives 1535 + 16 =1551.........602 
months at 2.5 points per month = 1521.
October 1999 Low 1232......2/8 plus mini 1/8 gives 1552. Recent low March 22nd at 
1081........when price fell below 1232 it moved back into the previous range of 923 - 
1552.......range 2/8ths plus 923 gives 1080.25. Also 1 year from High. 1081 is also part of
an octave from both 1552 and lower top of 1530 (September). All you have to remember 
is Gann used 1/8ths and 1/3rds......and an octave has 8 
UNEQUAL divisions. Also divisions of octaves can themselves be divided into mini 
octaves....up to 6 times according to PD Ouspensky.
I hope this has been useful.

Here is a good website on explaining scales and modes.
http://www.kent.wednet.edu/staff/dyadon/scales_modes.html
Scales are classfied into different types based on their interval pattern.
Most people are familiar with the Major scale such a a C Major = C D EF G A BC 
However, as you will see at the referenced website, there are as many modes as there are 
notes.
This in part is determined by where the scale is started, as it doesn't have
to start on the same note as indicated by its key, such as C Major, which is
in the key of C, starts on C and ends on C with no flats or sharps. If one
starts a C scale three notes away and plays the same notes but ending one
octave from where you started this would be a C minor. So you see major or
minor are only two of several possible modes. All Major scales follow the
above pattern, regardless of key, whole step, whole step, half step, whole
step, whole step, whole step, half step. Above, please note (pun alert!)
the intervals between the letters. Where the letters are touching, this is a
half tone which = 1.0594631. This number is based on all half tones of a
chromatic scale which is all possible half tones in an octave = 12 notes. If
you multiply 1.0594631 12 times you will get approximately 2. An octave or
number "24", i.e. the number of hours it takes for the Earth to rotate 360-deg on it's axis. 
As a Straight longitude, 311.25 would equal 11-deg 15-min Aquarius. On the circle chart, 
this number is located in Pisces. Take a look at the "Circle Chart". This should help.

If you just read Gann's work you will find all the answers....there are no real secrets. Take 
the S & P 500 cash index.......Major low Ist week January 1950 at 16.65.......March 24th 
2000 All time High......... Helio Jupiter moved 1531 * (degrees) plus 16 gives 1547, 
Saturn Helio moved 614*....at 2.5 points per degree gives 1535 + 16 =1551......... 602 
months at 2.5 points per month = 1521. 
October 1999 Low 1232......2/8 plus mini 1/8 gives 1552. Recent low March 22nd at

the same note one octave higher is two times the frequency of its lower
note. For example, a symphony tunes to the Violin open A string (one of 4
strings on the violin) = 440 cycles per second. 880 cps is also an "A" and
so is 220 cps. One can use these principles to figure out what tune the
market is playing. For example, I recollect that the cash S&P 500 topped on
March 24, 2000 at 1563? (I could be off by a few points - correct me if I am
wrong). You can use A 440 as a base. Go down two 1/2 intervals or divide 440
by 1.0594631 two times = 392 which is G . Now go up two octaves by
multiplying 392 by 2 and then again by 2 = two octaves = 1568 So you can
see that the top for the S&P 500 was near G. Now the question to ask is, in
what mode will the ensuing bear market be, such as will it decline ala G
Major, G Minor etc. One can tell by the first major levels on which it stops
or bounces. It would not be surprising for the market to chose a minor
scale for its decline becuase this is the scale for sad or "bluesie" type
music. Bull markets are probably in Major keys. But, that would just be my
first guess in our Name That Tune analysis. Anyway, have fun with this and
please share any inspriations you may get with the list.
Now, for a story as how to get good at this stuff. One day a young
musician was rushing down a New York City sidewalk to get to his concert
with violin case in hand, . He suddenly and unknowling crashed into famed
violinist Isaac Stern. Startled, he looked up and hurriedly said,
"Sir, could you please tell me how to get to Carnegie Hall?" Isaac Stern
replied with paced deliberation, "Practice...., practice...., practice!"
That's our music lesson for today. Remember, practice..., practice...,
practice!!
Musically,
Norman
P.S. Please feel free to correct any facts that may be wrong. I started
violin at age 8 but was mostly taught only how to play the notes in front of
me and almost no music theory. Most of the little bit of music theory I
know I learned on my own in the past few years. Isaac Stern wasn't
available.<G>
Serge,
Just stick with the simple scale.....do = 1, re = 9/8, mi = 5/4, fa = 
4/3, sol = 3/2, la = 5/3, si = 15/8, do = 2. 
You can see each of these equates to Gann's 1/8ths and 1/3rds. Can 
you see the retardation in the increase between mi and fa and si and 
the same note one octave higher is two times the frequency of its lower 
note. For example, a symphony tunes to the Violin open A string (one of 4 
strings on the violin) = 440 cycles per second. 880 cps is also an "A" and 
so is 220 cps. One can use these principles to figure out what tune the

do? Now reread Gann's Ticker Tape interview when he talks about 
vibrations and stocks at times becoming slow and other times becoming 
active and leading the market. Also the space between do and re, re 
and mi etc can also be divided into octaves ( up to a maximum of 6 
times according to PD Ouspensky). PD Ouspensky also says that a 
vibration can begin anywhere at a point in time (read price), Gann 
used the all time low as Do and followed forever on and upwards. I am 
amazed at how people want to make things regarding Gann so 
complicated.........just read his Profits book and buy either his 
Commodities Course(which I use) or his Stock Course, they seem to be 
self explanatory.

I believe you can buy the tape of her presentation for $89 from the MTA
A quick search of my files found this description of her presentation;
Constance Brown, CMT, CPO, of Aerodynamic Investments Inc., delivered a 
multimedia marvel that tested the limits of PowerPoint and demonstrated what 
lies at the edges of research in the discipline of technical analysis. Brown began 
with an overview of Gann's Square of Nine and explained how it overlapped 
some of the ratios that occur in the Fibonacci Square that creates the well-
known spiral. She then promised to decode the mystery behind the Square of 
Nine. The bottom line is that we learned that Gann's price wheels are calculators
that identify harmonic frequencies.

Beginning her proof in ancient Greece, most of the audience learned for the first time that
Pythagoras discovered the Golden Ratio in 560 BC by means of sound. He heard metal 
banging against metal while walking past what could be considered a blacksmith shop 
and that discovery led to his belief that mathematics and music defined universal laws. 
Pythagoras further postulated that celestial and acoustic motion have the same methodical
basis. Brown explained that within the cult-like following that developed around 
Pythagoras, only propositions proven by math were accepted as universal truths.
Brown explained that Galileo the astronomer was in fact trying to study motion and 
harmonic relationships in our solar system from the musical propositions defined by 
Pythagoras. Galileo's work in music was later continued by the famous Swiss 
mathematician named Leonard Euler, which Brown explained led to the equal tempered 
twelve-tone musical scale with logarithmically equal intervals between each tone that we 
are familiar with today. This is when we saw mathematical evidence that all of Gann's 
Angles used to define critical trendlines in charts were in fact cyclical octaves. But 
Octaves alone would not define all the numbers within a Gann Wheel so we had to learn 
more about the mathematics of historical music scales and there construction to decode 
the Square of Nine.
The modern day music scale has major harmonic flaws and we learned how only an 
ancient scale retained perfect relationships that surprisingly duplicated the ratios within 
the Fibonacci Square. Brown then used advanced geometrical concepts to convert a linear
music scale into a three dimensional matrix and we saw how it transformed into Gann's 
Hexagon Wheel. This concept evolved further and we saw how the Hexagon Wheel was 
in fact an icosahedron, a three dimensional model incorporating the Golden Ratio and a 
model first described by Plato. Obviously, we operate with some good company.
Adding another layer of proof to her thesis, Connie displayed copies of the original pages
of Galileo's work on motion that introduced in 1609 the "Theorem of Equivalence." We 
had thought Gann had first defined this concept, but what Gann called price/time 
equivalence was in fact Galileo's Theorem of Equivalence applied.

Just a thought. If planetary influences affect human emotions (activity) shouldn't or 
wouldn't that be reflected in volume levels rather than price action? TA's who know 
volume say that Volume leads price action. Gann also says that no Bull or Bear market 
can take place before adequate accumulation or distribution takes place, we are all aware 
how market makers can manipulate prices to reflect their own holdings but they can't hide
volume. Maybe someone should look at volume levels during the waxing and waning of 
orbs. If anyone has done any work on this I would be interested in discussing this with 
them.

The reason I mentioned volume was as follows, if astrology works as people say on this 
site, then say, take the Natal chart of IBM when Jupiter or Saturn etc approaches the Asc, 
MC Sun or Moon or an important trine or square is formed surely activity(emotion) in the
form of increased or decreased volume should occur. For those who ignore Natals and 
just use the mass psychology at times of angular transits then surely that should also 
show up in increased or decreased activity, ie increased volume on down days due to 
negative influences etc. I'm not decrying astrology because as you've seen I have used 
Heliocentric degrees in getting price targets for the S&P 500. We seem to have a similar 
argument on this site as that between Stock fundamentalists and technical analysts, if all 
knowledge is encapsulated in the price why worry about a companies potential future 
earnings etc ( read astros). None of these comments are meant to inflame anyone's 
feelings, on the contrary, if the comments come back help then I guess we all benefit.
Some time ago I wrote about being excited by a book I had bought called Selected 
writings by George Lindsay......one section was called Interpreting the Stock Market Day 
-By-Day. He explained a method of trading the Dow without using any indicators or 
timing signals that could be completed in a few minutes per day......pretty cool I thought! 
I started tracking his method on 6-22-01. I trade the S&P so I used his method on that 
index because it was roughly at the same level the Dow was in his example from 1979-
1980. Only the volatility levels ie: the days spread was changed to allow wider ranges. 
These are the results to date.
Buy 6-27.........Sell 7-2.......Buy.....7-10...1 day early on S&P500 exact on 
Dow........Sell.......7-19....The next bit was tricky but with more data and a bit of logic it 
would be obvious (thank heavens for stops!)......No signal but 7-25 was way above any 
previous level in terms of up-down volume and near equal highs of advances - declines....
Sell 8-2-01. Still short until new signal appears. No MA's, no stochastics no cumulative 
volumes etc etc......no astrology! 
I'm sure this would also work on the Nasdaq because that has its own advances, declines 
and up down volume figures.
On a side note I came across a $10 book called Sun, Moon, & Earth...only a small book 
but really an eye opener....especially in regard to how the ancients knew phi and its 
relation to the above cycles over 4500 years ago.....it may also inadvertently have given 
the clue to the Biblical 40 days and 40 nights.....the moons apsides move 40* each year 
and also mentions a lot about sq roots angles etc etc.....ISBN 0-8027-1381-5.....another 
companion book is Sacred Geometry also $10 (again an amazing eye opener- an 8 sided 
star in a square can exactly divide it into 9,16, or 25 - the squares of 3,4 and 5.....I never 
knew that!!).....ISBN 0-8027-1382-3.
Happy Trading

Two parts to my response:
(1) A technicality of English grammar is that a paragraph on a page means a paragraph 
that STARTS on a page (sometimes referred to as a "full paragraph"). Thus, 
*technically*, the 2nd paragraph on page 199 begins, "Days, weeks and months...."

However, a lot of people would consider the paragraph that begins, "October, 1927...", to 
be the 2nd paragraph. Which "paragraph" are you referring to?
(2) In either case above, the answer to your question is "no". An online market friend and 
I are plugging away at "decoding" TTTTA, but other topics seem to catch our attention, 
too. I know bits and pieces of TTTTA, and I have been learning more and more little by 
little since 2009--at least until now. I say that because I am now a "student"/participant in 
Lorrie Bennett's LOV by the Patterns and LOV by the Numbers (the first 2 volumes of 
4--the other two are LOV by the Planets and LOV by Geometry), published by Sacred 
Science. These are quite a large amount of information to absorb and apply, so it's going 
to take me a long while. (Besides, at age 72, I'm in the middle of a multi-month project of
moving in with one of my daughters.) As you most likely already know, there are NDAs 
(non-disclosure agreements) for these, and so I 'm not permitted to talk about anything in 
these volumes.
I realize my "no" answer to your question may be disappointing, but that's all I can 
honestly say at this point, given the holes in my knowledge of TTTTA. If my friend and I
get to "decoding" that portion of the book, I'll be happy to perhaps give you a different 
answer at that time.
Thanks for your inquiry! (I thought this group had "died", but I'm so glad that you seem 
to have resurrected it again!)

Hi Swagman,
The code Peter wrote had no meaning and my response with Jupiter/Uranus 
trines had no intended   meaning either   😂.
Now back to business reading Gann , he referred to October and sunshine 
and the previous October in 1926. Take it from me you are not meant to 
interpret or decode anything , you are meant to find FACTS Gann left for 
you because anything that anybody decodes and interprets without FACTS 
which cannot be disputed is utter BS.
1. Look up the Geo ephemeris for October 1926 you find Sat/Uranus trine on
30/10 , in the Helio ephemeris the Sat/Uranus trine is on 24/10 the day 
after the date he gives on 23/10 with sunshine again.
2. In Oct 27 in Geo there is nothing and in Helio there is on 28/10 a 
Jupiter/Uranus Conjunction .
However, a lot of people would consider the paragraph that begins, "October, 1927...", to 
be the 2nd paragraph. Which "paragraph" are you referring to?

### Deep Analysis — Advanced WD Gann Group Forum

**Major Topics Covered:**

1. **SQ9 as Square Root Calculator:**
   - The Square of Nine is fundamentally a square root price calculator
   - To find support/resistance: √Price ± 0.25 (45°), ± 0.5 (90°), ± 1.0 (180°), ± 2.0 (360°), then square the result
   - Example: Price = 100, √100 = 10, next 180° level = (10+1)² = 121, next 360° = (10+2)² = 144

2. **Summation Formula:**
   - n/2 × (n+1) = sum of first n numbers (triangular numbers)
   - Gann used this to calculate cumulative cycle lengths
   - 1+2+3+...+n = n(n+1)/2 — these sums appear as natural cycle lengths

3. **Planetary Geocentric Averaging:**
   - Average the geocentric longitudes of multiple planets
   - Convert the average to price (using the longitude-to-price method)
   - This creates composite planetary support/resistance levels

4. **Squaring Price with Time:**
   - When √Price = Time elapsed (in appropriate units), the market is "squared"
   - This is the most powerful Gann signal — expect a major reversal
   - Units must be consistent (convert price and time to the same numerical scale)

5. **Fibonacci-Gann Relationship:**
   - Fibonacci ratios appear naturally in the SQ9 spiral
   - 144 (Fibonacci) is a master Gann number (12² = 144)
   - The golden ratio connects Fibonacci retracements to Gann angle divisions

6. **Death Zone:**
   - Specific region on the SQ9 where prices stall and reverse violently
   - Occurs when price is between two major cardinal/diagonal lines with no harmonic support
   - Highest risk area for trades

7. **1260 Saros Cycle:**
   - Biblical number: 1260 days = 3.5 years = 42 months
   - Half of the master cycle 2520
   - Saros eclipse cycle: 6585.33 days ≈ 18.03 years
   - Gann used eclipse cycles for long-term market forecasting

8. **Master Numbers:**
   - 3, 7, 9, 12, 144, 360, 1260, 2520
   - These are the fundamental building blocks of all Gann cycles
   - Every major market cycle can be expressed as a multiple or fraction of these numbers

**Key Insight:** The Advanced Group reveals that Gann's methods are all interconnected — the SQ9, planetary methods, Fibonacci, and biblical cycles are all expressions of the same underlying mathematical harmony (the Law of Vibration).

of the XMI points, thereby increasing signicantly the odds of a correct trade. While applied 
here to the turning points I derive, this same validating approach can and should be used 
with any turning point system.
Turning point systems produce dates likely to be points of trend change, without necessarily 
calling for a high or a low. In my case, I have dates representing three cycles contained in the 
Dow or similar market averages, such as a losing trade. Further, if the market behaved normally, 
it could be expected to return to line C before a top was in place. I began looking for such a 
top as the summer progressed, and had noted the resistance offered by 1:1 line F. As August 
approached, I had an AstroDow cluster of an AD2 on 8/24 and an AD3 on 8/27. The latter was 
exactly one year from the 8/27/86 high from which line C originated. As the price action formed, 
it exactly touched line C on 8/13 and 8/25, the latter being within the AstroDow turning point 
cluster. Further analysis showed that this point was three months and a few days from 5/20, as 
well as at 541, exactly on the 180 degree angle on the Square of Nine. Going short for a return 
to at least line A was a high probability trade, with a stop at 543.
In both of these cases, I had used AstroDow turning point clusters to come up with 
a hypothetical change in trend date. Then I used basic Gann lines, time cycles, and the 
Square of Nine to conrm the hypothesis. This systematic application of Gann’s work to 
support my own work allowed me to trade both of these points correctly and protably. I also 
recognized the coming crash when line B was broken, but that’s another story for another 
time. Meanwhile, if you trade any sort of turning point system, try supporting it with this 
trio of Gann techniques. 
In mid May, 1987, as the market was declining, I was awaiting a major turn, based on 
having a triple cluster of AstroDow points. I had an AD2 point 5/25, an AD3 on 5/26, and AD4 
on 5/24. All of these points were expected to be lows, because the prior point in each cycle 
was a high. By that time I also had a pretty solid up channel formed by lines A and C, with 
secondary channel bottom formed by line B. All of these are standard Gann 2:1 lines which rise 
1/2 point per-day. From the top on 4/7, I also had drawn the down sloping 1:1 line D. Where 
this line intersected line B on 5/20 could be a support area. Further checking of possible cycles 
(see [4]) reminded me that we were six months from the sharp Boesky low of 11/19/1986. So 
there I was, with everything saying a major bottom was about to happen, and possibly a few 
days earlier than the AstroDow cluster.
When the market made a low on 5/20, then closed higher 5/21, I knew that the probabilities 
that the major bottom was in place were very high, about as close to certainty as one can be in 
the market. Further, the XMI index, which follows the Gann Square of Nine nicely, bottomed at 
432, just one square off the 270 degree axis. It was possible to buy here with a very close stop, 
with little fear of  a losing trade. Further, if the market behaved normally, it could be expected 
to  return to line C before a top was in place. I began looking for such a top as

By Gregory Legrand Meadors
In recent months, we have heard a great deal about astrology, especially the role it has played 
in the White House. This began a nationwide media focus on astrology, and its use in the 
nancial markets. When you consider the nancial power of foreign investors, many who use 
astrology, it should not surprise you that the markets often reect astrological timing methods. 
Financial astrologers had information available to precisely forecast both the exact August 
top and the October crash! Why then, are the astrologers sometimes wrong? Perhaps if we 
look to W.D. Gann, the legendary nancial predictor, we may nd the answer. We know 
that Gann did not reveal his most valuable knowledge in his stock and commodity courses. 
For example, only through his writings did he advise students to read the Bible three times 
to obtain knowledge.
W. D. Gann did not rely on only one system to predict price movements. He used a variety 
of techniques, such as astronomical cycles which many astrologers fail to use. For example, 
Jupiter’s position at the exact Dow low in August 1982 was at three degrees Scorpio. Jupiter’s 
rst opposition (180 degrees, 1/2 circle, cycle) to this sensitive degree (for the Dow) in the 
heavens was on March 22, 1988. A trend change occurred at this time!
Some of the more “modem” theories of market forecasting actually are mathematical 
principles that have ancient esoteric sources. For example, one theory uses the mathematical 
Fibonacci ratio which is revealed in the Great Pyramid. The problem with this approach is not 
accuracy, but rather reliance on only one forecasting method. Many followers of this method 
were looking for the Dow to explode during 1987 and reach the target of 3600. Because of their 
lack of knowledge of Biblical and astronomical cycles (some of these are also revealed in the

unexpectedly into the October Crash.
The top of the market in August 1987 and the October Crash were forecasted months 
in advance in my Market Systems March 1987 newsletter. The reason these moves were 
predictable was that they were confirmed by astrological (see the article “Gann and the 
Planets,” August/September issue of the Gann & Elliott Wave), astronomical, numerological, 
and other time cycles that are found in one of the most enlightening sources that Gann 
recommended the BIBLE!
Many people have been misled about the nancial markets by brokerage rms, nancial 
news, etc.; and misled about Scripture by some religious viewpoints. Many know about the 
“three” wise men who followed the star which shone above the manger where baby Jesus was 
born. Yet Scripture clearly states that the (many) Magi (astrologers) visited Jesus when he was 
a “young child” in a house! (Matt. 2:11) During that time Jupiter (royal star) and Saturn (Israel) 
came together in a bright conjunction in the sign of Pisces (symbolized by two sh; Jesus feeds 
5000 with two sh). This conjunction was probably located in the “Midheaven (Zenith)” of Jesus’ 
birth chart which would explain the “star above the house of Jesus” as the misunderstood 
astrologer’s reference to a “star in the Midheaven House.”
Scripture does state that you are not to worship or serve the stars (as gods or idols). Many 
believe therefore, that obtaining knowledge from the heavens (astrology) is evil. Yet Scriptures 
also state that God uses the heavens for signs and to provide knowledge to those who have 
wisdom and understanding. “And God said, Let there be lights in the rmament of the heaven 
to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, 
and years.” (Genesis 1:14). Note the scriptures Genesis 15:5 and Genesis 37:5-10. Jacob 
did not respond to Joseph’s rst dream but recognized the importance of the second dream 
when God used the sun, moon, and stars to represent Jacob, his wife, and children. According 
to the book Astrological Secrets of the Hebrew Sages, by Rabbi Dobin, all the astrological 
and astronomical references in the Old Testament of the Bible would be equivalent to over 
two full pages of the New York Times!
The Biblical view, of course, is that God is Omniscient and Supreme, and the inuences of 
the heavens only provide an indication of His Divine Will. “Can you bind the sweet inuences of 
Pleiades (cluster of stars), or loose the bands of Orion? Can you lead forth Mazzaroth (signs of 
the Zodiac) in their season? Or can you guide Arcturus (the stars of the Bear) with her young 
(satellites)? Do you know the ordinances of heaven? Can you establish their rule upon the 
earth?” (Job 38:31-33) “The Heavens declare the glory of God, and the rmament shows and 
proclaims His handiwork. Day after day pour forth speech, and night unto night shows forth 
knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.” (Psalms 19:1-3) 
Thus everyone can see God’s pattern of creation in the heavens. “They fought from heaven: the 
Great Pyramid), their myopic forecast doomed them to major losses when the Dow reversed 
unexpectedly into the October Crash.

In the nancial markets the length of days before a trend change is critical for market timing. 
“Happy is the man that ndeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding    Length of days 
is her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honor  The Lord by wisdom hath founded the 
earth; by understanding hath He established the heavens.” (Prov. 3:13-19)
Mars entered the sign Gemini on April 6, 1987 exactly timing the double top on the Dow. 
The length of days in this sign ended when Mars left Gemini and entered Cancer on May 21, 
1987 exactly timing the length of days of this correction!
In the last issue I explained how the widely advertised Harmonic (planetary) Convergence 
(see Newsweek: 8/17/87) exactly timed the top in the Dow and why the October 6, 1987 
lunar eclipse timed the start of the October crash. It amazes me how some can ignore these 
correlations. What could be more natural than the precision timing and mathematical beauty 
of cosmic cycles to time earthly cycles? Consider the moon, that faithful witness, whose axis 
rotation exactly equals the time it takes to circle the earth. (Psalm 89:37)
The Earth is a magnet, which is surrounded by a vast sea of electromagnetic energy. Most 
of this energy comes from the sun. Humans also produce electromagnetic energy through 
their nervous systems. Water covers most of the Earth and our bodies are mostly water. The 
moon affects the water on Earth (tides), and eclipses have a drastic effect upon the earth’s 
magnetic eld. Is it illogical to conclude that these cosmic events could also have an effect on 
human behavior and (investor) psychology? Where does the word “lunatic” come from? Johann 
Kepler,known as one of the founders of modern astronomy stated: “The planets forming angles 
(aspects) upon the earth by their luminous beams, of strength to stir up the virtue of sublunary 
things, have compelled my unwilling belief.”
Two of the more interesting references in the Bible for nancial information are the 1 1/2 and 
3 1/2 year Biblical cycles. In Revelation the 3 1/2 year cycle is conjoined with the 12 signs of the 
stars (planets) in their courses fought against Sisera.” (Judges 5:20) 
In the financial markets the length of days before a trend change is critical for market timing.

woman clothed with the U.N., with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars  and his 
tail swept away one third of the stars of heaven... She had a place prepared by God, so that there 
she might be nourished for 1260 days (3 1/2 years).” (Rev. 12:1-6)
The astronomical and nancial signicance of these scriptures points to the Saros eclipse 
cycles. Saros (meaning “repetition”) refers to the name of the complete cycle of eclipses, for 
it was noticed that the eclipses would return to the exact location in each of the 12 signs of 
the zodiac every 6585 and one-third days. The rotation of the earth for the extra one-third day 
causes one-third of the background stars (that are visible on the previous eclipse cycle) to be 
“swept” from view. A complete series of Saros eclipse cycles occurs every 1260 years. According 
to Van Nostrand’s Scientic Encyclopedia, this was known by the Babylonians as early as 1000 
B.C. The correlation of these Scriptures with the Saros eclipse cycles is unmistakable. Notice 
that when you multiply 360 (degrees of a circle) by the Biblical 3 1/2 measure you obtain both 
the Saros eclipse and Biblical number 1260.
One might be thinking at this point, “What does this have to do with the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average?” When you multiply the Biblical 1260 days by the I 1/2 time cycle you 
obtain 1890 days. Add this length of days to the start of the bull market in August 1982 and 
you have the start of the October 1987 crash! Multiply the August 1982 closing low of 777 
(7 represents completion) by the 3 1/2 cycle and you obtain 2719.50, within three points of 
the 2722 Dow Jones August 1987 all time high! We sold all long positions at the high on 
the August 24, 1987 new moon. Our IBM call options generated over 250% prot. We then 
shorted the OEX on August 27, 1987.
In his book, Truth of the Stock Tape. Gann states that he used astrology and made 
forecasts based upon the numerical values of letters in a name. Few understand what Gann 
meant, and yet, most people are familiar with the “number of the beast (666)”, depicted in “The 
Omen” series of movies. “Here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding count the number 
of the beast; for it is the number of a man; and his number is 666.” (Revelation 13:18) If you 
count the numerical value of the “NEW
YORK STOCK EXCHANGE INCORPORATED, WALL ST, NEW YORK, NEW YORK” using 
standard numerical values (a=l, b=2, i=9,j=l) you will end up with 666! For example, “WALL 
ST” equals (5+1+3+3+1+2) = 15 = 6.
(John 1:1), but he does not reveal all his “pearls of wisdom” (Matthew 7:6). Consider the 
words “prot” and “prophet” which have the same sound “vibration”. In The Tunnel Thru the 
Air, Gann states that the Biblical story of the prophet Jonah contains many “keys” to market 
timing. The words in the rst three verses of Jonah reveal a priceless time cycle “key” to 
those who have Biblical knowledge. This “key” precisely timed the record breaking 86 point 
drop on 9/11/86 (options paid 5 34%) and the record 508 point drop on 10/19/1987 (options 
paid over 100 to I). This market timing “key” applies to stock and commodity markets and is 
included in my Market Timing Course.

By Granville Cooley
Forty-four is a Fibonacci number. Sixty-seven and one-half degrees is a Fibonacci number. 
Two-hundred and sixty-six is a Fibonacci number. Three-hundred and sixty degrees is 
a Fibonacci number. For those few of you who have never heard of Fibonacci numbers 
I can see you saying, “So what?”
For those of you who have “read” about the Fibonacci numbers, I can see you doing a double 
take. For those of you who are supposed to be Fibonacci experts, I can see your eyeballs rolled 
back, clicking in your head, and your feet up in the air as in a Mut and Jeff cartoon. The cartoon 
has a big balloon which reads, “He’s got it! He’s got it! By Gann, He’s got it!”
Those who have read about Fibonacci are saying, “What’s this Gann stuff? I thought 
Fibonacci has to do with Elliott Waves.”
It does, but there is also a Gann side to the Fibonacci phenomenon, sometimes apparent, 
but often not. It is quite possible that the Gann relationship to Fibonacci has been explored, 
but if so, I have seen little evidence of it.
I am talking about such things as:
(I)            The master numbers.
(2) The angles.
(3) The signs and seasons.
(4) The signs and degrees.
(5) The stone of Simon.
(6) The eighth square.
(7) The death zone and the circle.
(8) The wanderings and the pyramid.
(9) The Great Cycle of Enoch.
We could add more but that’s plenty for our purposes now. Let’s investigate the phenomenon 
of Fibonacci of the above nine items with what I call simple observational arithmetic.
I say that because persons who write on Elliott, Gann, and other math wizards are used to 
writing in mathematical terms, not always understood by the average person.
Like many of you, I had a little algebra and geometry in high school and a little algebra in 
college, but my eld for 20 years was journalism. And when you don’t have many reasons for 
using algebra and geometry over the years, it becomes hazy.
Books have been written on the markets by mathematicians showing the mathematical 
formulas behind certain systems. But they seem to be targeted for other mathematicians and 
those persons working with computers.
Those books are probably very good for those who understand the formulas, but one 
gentlemen, well known in the markets and considered a market genius in his own right, said 
he didn’t understand the books at all.
So methods I use might seem very elementary to those with a higher learning of math. If 
so, I ask them to bear along with those of us of less mathematical background as we explore 
the nine topics above in simple observational arithmetic.

either. I’ve read a few books on such and can see some links with the Gann material, but 
that doesn’t make me an expert.
As I said before, my eld was journalism, and I’m no expert in that either so don’t look 
for a journalistic gem in this article.
My “arithmetic” approach to Gann was to run thousands of numbers through a calculator 
looking for patterns that showed up in math, astrology, astronomy, and Masonic books, was well 
as sundry other books. Those patterns provided the basis for several “discoveries.”
 Before moving on the nine topics above, let’s look at a couple of “amazing” facts that 
are noted by Fibonacci experts.
 One of the “amazing facts” is that the ratio of the rst term to the second term in a 
Fibonacci series is 1.618 and from the rst term to the third term is 2.618. They also like to 
tell us that if we divide the second term into the rst and multiply that times the 1.618 ratio, 
we will come up with the number one.
Let’s put down two groups of three Fibonacci numbers and a group of three non-Fibonacci 
numbers and see what we can nd by simple arithmetic observation.
Since all Fibonacci numbers do not t the 1.618 ratio exactly, let’s put down the ones that are 
the closest and eye ball them. The three numbers are 55, 89, and 144.
When we divide 55 into 89 we get 1.6181818. And when we divide 55 into the next higher 
Fibonacci number, 144, we get 2.6181818.
Now let’s look at another series not so perfect but yet of the same Fibonacci series, 
8,13, and 21. First, we divide 8 into 13 and get 1.625 and we divide 8 into the next higher 
number and get 2.625.
All very interesting. Now let’s look at some non-Fibonacci numbers picked at random. 
Let’s use the year 1988 and separate it into two numbers 19 and 88, and add the 19 to 
the 88 so we get the following sequence, 19, 88, and 107. Next, we nd the relationship 
between the rst number and the second, and the rst and the third, in the same way we 
did the other two sequences.
We divide 19 into 88 and get 4.6315789. When we divide 19 into 107 we get 5.63 
15789.
In all three cases above, the whole numbers changed when we divided the rst number into 
the second and then the third, but the decimal fraction did not. What’s going on here?
The mathematician is lighting his pipe and saying, “Elementary, my dear Watson, 
observe what you did.”
Let’s observe. In the rst sequence the division by 55 into 89 can be counted as one 
unit of 55 with 34 left over, and the fraction of 34 divided by 55 is .6181818. When we added 
55 to 89 to get 144, we simply added another unit of 55 to the pot which gives us two units 
of 55, or 110 with 34 left over.
That remainder of 34 divided by 55 will always be .6l81818. We could keep adding 55 to 
the pot and dividing by 55 till the cows come home and we would still end up with a remainder 
of 34. The whole number would grow but the decimal fraction would always be the same. 
Try it for yourself. It works every time.
Let’s look at the second sequence of 8, 13, and 21. When we divide 8 into 13 we get one 
unit of 8 plus 5 left over, which represents .625 of 8. When we add 8 to the 13 to get 21, we are 
simply adding another 8 to the pot. Dividing 8 into 21 we have two units of 8 with 5 left over

which equal 76 with 12 left over. The remainder of 12 divided by 19 gives us the decimal 
fraction, .1635789. By adding 19 to 88 to get 107, we are simply adding 19 to the pot of 88 
and getting ve 19’s, or 95 with 12 left over. Need I tell you about the remainder of 12 and 
the cows again? It’s still working!
Now for the second “amazing fact” about Fibonacci numbers that the experts like to point 
out to us. The fact that when you multiply 1.618 by .618 you get one or to be more exact 
.999924. The reason why the multiplication does not equal one is because the two Fibonacci 
ratios have been rounded off.
The two Fibonacci ratios are obtained by dividing the smaller Fibonacci number into the 
larger and then the larger into the smaller. Let’s take the rst part of our rst example, 55 and 89. 
When we divide 89 by 55 we get l.6l81818 as before, and then we divide 55 by 89 and obtain .6 
179775. When we multiply the two results we get .9999999.
From our second example we can use 8 and 13. Dividing 8 into 13 we get 1.625 as before. 
Dividing 8 by 13 we get .6153846. Multiplying the two results we get .9999995.
Let’s pull a Dr. Watson and observe what we have done. In each case we divided a smaller 
number into a larger one and then the larger one into the smaller one and multiplied the results, 
getting a decimal number almost equal to one. The reason for it not being exactly one is the 
rounding off that has to be done.
So let’s express each of the numbers as fractions and then multiply. We can express 
89 divided by 55 as 89 over 55; and 55 divided by 89 as 55 over 89. We multiply and 
get 4895 over 4895. Any number over itself or divided by itself is always one. The same 
procedure for 8 and 13 gets us 104, over 104 or one. Ditto for 19 and 88 which equals 
1672 over 1672 or one.
In our review of the two properties of the Fibonacci sequence we have really found 
nothing magic or amazing. It is simply how our mathematical system works. Interesting, 
but not amazing.
Now let’s look at some of the other interesting properties of the Fibonacci sequence 
starting rst with the Master numbers.
(This is the rst  part of a longer report by Grandville Cooley. Those interested in seeing more of 
this material should write him at #71 Lone Oak Village, Paris, Tenn. 38242)
In the third sequence of 19, 88, and 107, we divide 88 by 19 and get four units of 19 
which equal 76 with 12 left over. The remainder of 12 divided by 19 gives us the decimal 
fraction, .1635789. By adding 19 to 88 to get 107, we are simply adding 19 to the pot of 88 
and getting five 19’s, or 95 with 12 left over. Need | tell you about the remainder of 12 and 
the cows again? It’s still working!

By Toby Crabel
This is a study of range expansion and its impact on the market. Other analysts have 
assumed that Range Expansion has an impact on price action on the day or days following 
range expansion. With the computer it becomes very easy to validate or invalidate this 
assumption. To begin with, it is necessary to set up a control or standard of comparison, so I 
borrowed from a previous study (Price Pattern Studies 1 - Bonds Open/Close Studies). In that 
study I tested all two, three, four, and ve-day patterns in the T-Bond market, 1978 -1986. In 
order to make a proper comparison, I did the exact same test with only one added variable, 
an expanding daily range relative to the previous day’s range on the second to the last day 
of each price pattern. From there it was possible to make direct comparisons between Price 
Pattern Studies (August/September issue of Gann & Elliott Wave) and the Price Pattern with 
the added variable of range expansion.
To briey review what Table A is showing, refer to Pattern #5. Simply, this pattern is two 
lower closings and a lower open. This is read from left to right. An entry is assumed on the open 
or the minus to the far right of the pattern. Exit was on the close of the same day, thus the same 
open to close patterns. All patterns are set up in the same manner, but as you can see, become 
more complex as more days are included. Regardless of the number of days, the (+) or (-) sign 
in the pattern is always relative to the day immediately preceding it, and are closings unless it is 
the last (+) or (-) sign in the pattern which is an open.
My conclusion from that comparison is that there is a denite bias in the direction of the 
range expansion the day immediately following. Over 75 percent of the time, the price pattern 
showed either a percentage protability favoring the bias of the range expansion, and/or an 
average win/loss ratio that made it clear that the range expansion was inuencing the price 
pattern. There was one problem with the comparison--there was an obvious upward bias 
throughout the period. This was reected in the inability of the range expansion to have an 
appreciable impact on patterns ending with (--) or (++).
In the control study, almost all patterns ending with (--) showed an upward bias from open 
to close. The same was true for the study on range expansion and in some cases it actually 
produced a better trade. This was contrary to expectations. Logically, the market should exhibit 
a bias in the direction of the range expansion, but in fact the range expansion seemed to be 
acting as a selling climax rather than a momentum increase.
This was bafing and the thought occurred to me that this was not a vigorous enough 
denition of range expansion. Consequently I decided to make a comparison between very 
simple two-day patterns and ve variables, one for each test (refer to Table B). The variables 
were: the narrowest range relative to the previous three days (NR3), Narrow Range relative 
to the previous day (NR), control which included all possible patterns either narrowing or 
expanding, Range Expansion relative to the previous day (RE), and a Range Expansion greater 
than the previous three days (RE3). There was thought to be enough of a contrast between 
Range Expansion 3 and Narrow Range 3

RE3 in each pattern group would give me the information that I was looking for. In the case of the 
(±+) pattern both the NR3 and the RE3 were protable sales with similar win/loss ratios. The only 
difference was the amount of total prot which favored the NR3. This is logical and in the case of 
an expanding range to the upside and subsequent higher open (RE3) should not be as good a 
sale as on a day without as much denition preceding it. It was not totally conclusive.
A comparison of RE3 and NR3 in the (-±) shows some clear differences. Both are protable 
buys, but percentages favor the NR3 pattern and win/loss ratio with total prots obviously 
favoring the NR3 over the RE3. Again, this is logical for a day that exhibits an expanding range 
to the down-side theoretically is increasing momentum, and the subsequent higher open should 
not be as favorable a buy relative to a day lacking such denition. The clearest difference 
comes in the (+-) pattern where the protable trades are actually in the opposite direction. 
The narrowest range in three days followed by a lower open proved to be a protable sale 61 
percent of the time, with a win/loss ratio of 1.17 :1, and total prots of $15,18l. The same pattern 
with the largest range in three days to the upside prior to a lower open proved a protable buy 
48 percent of the time with 1.10 : win/loss ratio and prots of $417. Total prots obviously are 
not dramatic in the case of the buy on the RE3 pattern, but there is a distinct contrast between 
the RE3 and the NR3 supporting the conclusion that range expansion does have an impact on 
subsequent price action. Where it is not so clear is in the pattern of a lower close followed by a 
lower open (--) where a momentum increase actually produced a better buying opportunity than 
on a day where there was no such range expansion. This can be explained by the dominant 
upward bias throughout the test period.
Nonetheless, it still seemed inconclusive that a range expansion was consistently impacting 
the subsequent price action. Therefore a third test sequence was done, this time taking into 
account only a higher close or a lower close. Again the variables of an expanding range relative 
to the previous three days, and a narrowing range relative to the previous three days were used 
in a direct comparison between the two. Entry was on close to open (C/O) and close to close 
(C/C) for either an overnight trade into the next day’s open or a trade from the given day’s close 
into the next day’s close. The thought here was that if range expansion was actually affecting 
the price action it would most likely show up from close to open, and if it was a particularly strong 
affect it would carry into close of the next day. On a lower close and the close to open trade, the 
RE3 proved to be a better sale in all respects except for a slight difference in win/loss ratio. A 
lower close with a close to close trade showed buys for both RE3 and NR3, but as expected the 
NR3 proved to be the better buy with win/loss ratio and total prots reective of this. In the case 
of a close to open trade, after a higher close there was a distinct difference favoring a buy in 
the direction of an RE3 over that of an NR3. In

trend is a stronger inuence than short-term momentum increase or decrease. In other words, 
the underlying intermediate long-term trend will take precedence over a momentum increase 
indicated by a range expansion against the trend. Range expansions with trend hold more 
signicance than if against trend. The psychology involved could be something as follows: In 
a strong up-trend, new shorts are constantly entering the market trying to pick the market top; 
the isolated range expansion to the down-side brings in more shorts; the high percentage open 
lower the following day and has very little follow through, and somewhere around mid-session 
after a bullish day, structure shorts begin to cover.
Emphasis should be placed on the necessity of integrating other market concepts along with 
range expansions. Without a rm grasp of the concept of day structure and a clear picture of the 
underlying trend, a trader will run into difculties using range expansion on its own.

By Chris Kakasuleff
In order to pin point the manifestation of events upon the physical earth plane, you must rst 
have a working knowledge of the astronomical mathematical formula. The 360 degree cycle 
popularized by W. D. Gann is our reference point. What did the wizard of Wall Street teach 
us about the great 360 degree cycle? The mathematical architect Gann generously left us a 
legacy of cosmic information to formulate into working principles to predict in advance short, 
intermediate, and long-term nancial market trends.
In my long cerebral journeys into the very core of the secrets of the universe, time and 
time again nature has unveiled its self tome by proving that its greatest secrets are revealed 
in an essence of simplicity.
Mr. Gann articulated that the jewel of the 360 degree cycle in predicting stock market 
trends was literally calendar time. Let’s make sure I heard myself correctly here. I said that to 
beat mighty Wall Street all I needed as working tools was a calendar and maybe a calculator. 
What a powerful tool this concept is. Let’s now construct a foundation and manifest working 
principles for this earth shattering news.
To become the captain of our destiny in protable stock transactions we need to follow 
certain guidelines and rules. First we must transpose calendar time onto the 360 degree 
circle. To devise our formula we must gaze upon the heavens and monitor the cosmic clock 
that regulates the motion of mother earth. The earth completes one revolution around the 
sun in 365.24 days.
To reconcile our revelation of calendar time being the domain for predicting market 
trends, we simply recognize the fact that the earth itself is at the mercy of the gravitational 
pull of the sun, therefore dictating its annual cycle of 365.24 days. As the Earth and its 
consciousness is the subordinate of the sun, so man and the manifestation of all events on

of natures most guarded secrets?
Mr. Gann taught us that the beginning of each renewed annual Earth cycle commenced at 
the spring equinox. Gann indicated that by counting days from March 21 that many of nature’s 
invisible secrets would be revealed. Gann went on to say that by no means was the stock market 
devoid or divorced from this natural calendar rhythm.
Just as the Earth has seasons of the year; a time to plant, a time to cultivate, a time 
to grow, a time to pluck, and a time to reap, so does Wall Street ebb and ow with this 
same circadian time piece.
My dear friend, please take time now to grasp this essence of universal law. Understand 
and cherish it as your eleventh commandment. By programming it into your belief system and 
consciously recognizing its manifestations in the drama of your own life’s enfoldment, you will 
then posses in your heart a glimpse of the truth of all things. You will understand that life deals 
out no random events. You will cherish the fact that you indeed are the navigator of your life’s 
destiny. You will discover the more you scratch at truth, the more it will itch.
As I mentioned earlier, Gann taught us that one avenue of endeavor using the cycle 365.24 
was to mark time from March 21. 1-Ic said to start by making March 21 our zero point. Thus 
making March 22 day one. Gann divided the year into six teen equal parts. By dividing the year 
by four, our sum is the beginning of each new season of the year.
The philosophy Gann was spot-lighting onto our tunnel vision was that March 21 was 
the commencement of the annual reincarnation of life’s new birth. By June 21 at the summer 
solstice point. Intense new growth had taken place in the animal, vegetable, plant, and insect 
kingdom. By the fall equinox on September 21 the peak of vitality was ebbing ever so slowly, 
and old age was replacing fruitarian as the dominant cycle. By the winter solstice, frozen and 
suspended animation ruled the northern hemisphere of the earth, and the suspended seeds 
of the perpetuation of life were invisible, as all life was hidden in the frozen tundra, meditating 
patiently for the return of the photons of light in the spring.
The wizard then instructed us to divide the year by eight. This gives us four more 
dates to consider. These are the halfway points of spring, summer, fall, and winter. Gann 
said to also divide the year by sixteen. This finally gives us sixteen important calendar 
days as our focus.
Gann told us that the most powerful resonating points using calendar time was six 
months or 180 degrees from the beginning point and then back around to the anniversary 
date itself. As summer becomes very hot and winter reaches frigid temperature extremes 
182 days later, so too does stock market action reach volatile extremes. What goes around 
truly does come back around.
The next important model points are the one quarter points. Using our calendar we quickly 
realize that these points are 91 days apart. Gann said to expect a change of trend in the stock 
market at these points. Our analogy concerning conrms this rule, as each season of the year 
guarantees a change of trend in climate conditions.
Gann went on to suggest that by dividing the year by eight, into 45 da

Anyone who is curious enough to research these dates will have discovered a new book 
of revelations. By just scooping the rst two dates on our chart for the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average for 1988 should be an eye opener. The Dow closed at its rst high for 1988 on Friday, 
March 18 at 2087. This date is one trading day before March 21. On our second date of April 
12 which corresponds to the 22 and one-half degree angle of the circle, the Dow closed at post 
crash highs at 2110 exactly on April 12. Two trading days later the Dow water-faIled 100 points 
in one day, conrming a change of trend.
This particular method of marking calendar time from March 21 is more appropriate for 
commodities, and raw materials that depend on the cycles of the seasons of the earth year.
An interesting sideline would be to take a closer look at the number 365.24. By multiplying 
this number by seven our sum total is 2556.68 days. This turns out to be precisely seven years 
of course, and the notorious seven year itch. The remarkable mind-boggler here is that 2556.68 
days equals out to exactly 365.24 weeks. This new information totally vindicates the perfect 
time cycle as being 365.24 and not 360. Anyone who has the capacity to computer generate 
the complete cycles of 365.24 days, weeks, or years will nd the mathematical validity of this 
sun generated number in stock market tops and bottoms. W. D. Gann discussed many times 
the power of the number seven in stock market action.
The timing of this article could prove to be quite revealing as August 12, 1989 is 
2556.68 days or 365.24 weeks from August 12. 1982. The aging bull will be seven years 
old on that day.
Remember micro-man/woman is trapped unconsciously in this same y paper cycle. All 
events upon the earth whether generated by group consciousness or individual karmic patterns 
must ow with the movement of these cosmic energies of space and time.
In my last article I discussed the power of the square of nine in predicting short term market 
highs and lows. We utilized this system to predict a short term high on March 5, 1988.
Well, it looks like we’ve got bragging rights, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 
2081 on Tuesday, March 8, only two trading days from March 5, which fell on a Saturday. This 
short term top was the post crash high up to that point, with a second top one trading day before 
the spring equinox on March 18, a Friday.
Is there a way to utilize this cycle of 365.24 to trade the market? There are specic rules to 
follow that I have found over time to be extremely dependable in trading stocks, stock options 
and stock index options. But, I don’t want to give away all my secrets.
I am now in the process of publishing an in-depth stock market course in market timing. 
This course will include many precise market tools to condently predict well in advance short, 
intermediate, and long-term market trends. The course will simplify the many complicated 
strategies proposed by W. D. Gann.
Each chapter will focus on a specic timing tool that in and of itself will prove to be 
protable. The course will include chapters on Gann geometry, and explain in a simplied 
way, the most protable way to use the angles to enter and exit trades. A complete chapter

By Jim Purucker
On page 62 of Gann’s book, How To Make Profits in Commodities, Gann states, 
‘After considering three important factors, time, formations, and resistance levels, 
the fourth and next very important factor is volume of sales. The volume of sales 
is the real driving power behind the market and shows whether supply and demand are 
increasing or decreasing. Large buying and selling orders are shown in the volume of sales. 
Therefore, a careful study of the volume of sales will assist in determining a change in trend, 
ESPECIALLY AFTER APPLYING THE OTHER THREE FACTORS OF TIME, FORMATION 
AND RESISTANCE LEVELS.”
In the previous articles of the Gann & Elliott Wave the rst three factors were presented 
for illustration. First, the astrological TIMING points for trading the minor cycle of one year.

Traders World                                                                                                                                         77an OFF-CON (I) & (2) condition. The third factor of importance was determining from a 
zero-degree beginning point of
TIME, a square (90 degrees) or trine (120 degrees) in time or price on the GANN WHEEL, 
combined with the odd and even natural square-root numbers on the GANN WHEEL for support-
resistance levels. The odd squares begin at the peak of the Gann Wheel, the Great Pyramid of 
Gizeh, with number one as the capstone. The next square root level, square or course of stones, 
begin at number two and ends with number nine or Y (three squared). The square root of these 
odd numbers, which fall on the xed angle of 41.475232 degrees to the South-West compass 
point, are the cornerstones for each course or square on the Great Pyramid.
An example in the previous article for the price high (2-5-88) on June ‘88 TBonds was 
94-17. Converting 94-17 to 1/32nd Bond ticks (94 x 32 + 17) equals 3025 ticks. The square 
root of 30252 equals 55 (55 x 55), an important resistance level. On the GANN WHEEL, the 
zero-degree line intersecting the two-digit number 75 (10-19-87) price low is 180 degree 
opposition number 94, or 19 bond points. The difference in ticks was 625 ticks (25Th 625 divided 
by 32nds equals 19-17 bond points. Therefore, number 75 (75-00) plus 19-17, equals 2-5-88 
PRICE HIGH at 94-17 (TO THE TICK)!
Now let’s analyze the September ‘88 T-Bonds. First, the astrological TIMING POINT to 
balance the week of 2-29-88 (l80) is due the week of 8-22-88, 9(1 square the week of 5-23-88 
is 8-22-88. Price was 90~ square from 93-17 to 83-17, within nine ticks of the low price of 
83-23 on the GANN WHEEL. Second, the G-A-N-N2- Buy formation began zero degrees on 
8-16-88, marked “G” at 83-23, “A” formed at 85-11 on 8-19-88, on 8-23-88, “N”, signaling a 
PREPARE TO BUY condition (OFF-CON 2).
At this point, a brief description of an OFF-CON condition I & 2 (OFE)ensive (CON)dition is 
in order. In the movie, “WAR GAMES” DEE-CON (DEF-ensive CON-ditions) were progressive 
stages of readiness prior to missile launch.
For brevity, I only use two conditions of readiness rather than the four conditions in the 
movie. A stage (2) OFF-CON is “PREPARE TO BUY,” a stage (I) OFF-CON is the actual pulling 
the trigger for the buy executions CONFIRMING the G-A-N-N2-Buy formation, similar to the 
DEFCON (I) condition in the movie, where the missiles are actually launched.
Now, let’s pick up on 8-25-88 when the price drops below 84-16, the price low of “N”, 
which signals an OFF-CON (2) state of readiness, PREPARE TO BUY condition. OFF-CON 
(2) also gives the right to draw a I x I angle from N2 where the buy stop orders are placed. 
The I x I angle from N2 was at 84-31 on 8-2-88. For those traders who have substantial 
amounts of capital to risk
(Fund Managers, Banks, S&Ls, Insurance Companies. Corporations and high-net-worth 
individuals), I suggest a TOTAL PYRAMID contract position of 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, or 
100,000 or more, using a 5-3-2=10, or 500-300-200=1,000 sequence to build the pyramid 
properly.
For this hypothetical trade, 1,000 contracts are placed thus: Place a Buy Stop for 500 
contracts ve bond ticks above the I x I angle of (84-31) at 85-04, next place a buy stop for 300 
contracts one bond tick above “A” (85-Il) the zero degree horizontal at 85-12, add the nal 200 
contracts M.O.C. at 85-2

On 8-29-88, the G-A-N-N2-Buy formation conrmed OFF-CON (I) condition with entry into 
Gann’s second section.
The rst objective to sell is 162 bond ticks added to the 83-23 low at “G”. One-hundred 
and sixty two bond ticks divided by 32 equals 5-02 bond points (83-23 + 5-02) 88-25 objective. 
Previous vibrations of 5-02 bond points (1+6+2=9). Why nine’? The number nine seems to have 
a denite “power” or “vibration.” Pythagoras is believed to have had a remarkable “WHEEL” 
by means of which he could predict future events. Look at the design and consturction of the 
GANN WHEEL (see ad in the GANN & ELLIOTT WAVE) the Trines 120Th240=9, l44=1+4+4=9, 
216=2+1+6=9, 288=2±8+8=l8, or 1+8=9, 72=7±2=9 and 360=3+6+0=9. Gann’s MASTER 
NUMBER 45=I+2+3+4+5+6+7+8±9454+59
Nine is the basis of the unit value of ALL numbers. On Friday, 9-2-88, the price objective 
88-25 was executed. Average cost for 1,000 contracts was 85-10. 88-25 minus 85-10 equals 
3-15 Bond Points, or $3,468.75 per contract times 1,000 equals $3,468,750, less commissions, 
fees, and slippage.
Now, Gann’s fourth factor VOLUME OF SALES as another KEY, signicant in trading 
T-Bonds. Notice the KEY TO DAILY VOLUME at trend turning points is 490,000+ contracts 
on 4-14-88, 6-1-88, 6-14-88, and 8-16-88. Here Gann says the trade has made up its mind, a 
change of trend is eminent and reveals it through ONE-DAY VOLUME of 490,000+ contracts. 
Yet, even with the KEY TO VOLUME, Gann, in his innite wisdom, says, “In order to be a 
success, “FOLLOW A DEFINITE RULE.” Remember Gann’s rule number 25? Let the market 
prove ills at bottom with the G-A-NN2-B formation as the formation, provided nine trading days of 
accumulation prior to conrmation of entry in OFF-CON (I) on 8-29-88.
In conclusion, I would like to make you aware of two Aphorisms of Pythagoras, number 
four and number nine (an aphorism is a short pointed sentence expressing a wise, clever 
observation or general truth). Number four states, “assist a man in raising or lifting his burden; 
but, do not assist him in laying it down.”
In this article I have done my best to help and assist you in your trading by giving you the tools 
to raise yourself up and out of the 90 percent losers, 10 percent winners ratio, which because of 
human nature, stays the same every year. However, you must be responsible for your losses, as 
well as your gains, and not place the blame for your losses on others.
Pythagoras’ aphorism number nine states, “offer not your right hand easily to anyone.” This 
statement warns not to offer wisdom and knowledge to those who are incapable of appreciating 
them. Gann would cast a birth chart (horoscope) of the individual purchasing his courses. In 
this way, he was trying to determine if the individual was skeptical or was capable of studying 
long and hard about the truths he was trying to teach. Gann wrote voluminous am-mounts of 
material to create a desire in the individual to search for hidden truths, much in the same way 
the ancients in the past clothed their secrets in veiled language; such as the writers of the Bible, 
Plato, Aristotle, and Pythagoras, to name a few.
Gann, in his wisdom, realized the unregenerate do not desire wisdom and knowledge, 
but through indolence w

By Norman Winski
Are you one of those people who have tried to read some of the writings by W.D. Gann and 
felt like you might as well be reading Greek? Consolation is here. Most beginning students 
of Gann’s works feel thoroughly confused, if not totally bafed. The situation is somewhat 
analogous to someone who picks up a book written in Greek, having absolutely no knowledge of 
Greek, and tries to understand those writings on assumption that they are reading English. The 
difference is that Gann’s writings utilize the English alphabet, therefore, wrongly reinforcing the 
illusion that he is communication to you in normal conversational English.
W.D. Gann was actually writing in another language” or jargon, but he usually didn’t 
bother to tell most people this.
The language of W.D. Gann is Astrology. All though the writings and charts of Gann are 
allusions to the principles of Astrology. For example, in your Gann research you may have 
noticed Gann’s use of the date of incorporation for a company, the date of the rst day of trading 
for a stock or futures contract, the zodiacal dates surrounding the “Square of Nine” chart, the 
planetary symbols found in his own handwritten market charts, the planetary ephemerides with 
his personal notes written inside found among his books, the use of angles basic to astrology, 
and the collaboration with other astrologers. I said “other astrologers” because rst and foremost, 
W.D. Gann was an astrologer. Everything else is supplementary.

a specialized branch of cycles. Gann liked to refer to it as “the law of nature” or “natural law.” 
The bottom line is that Gann said that timing was the most important factor and he based most 
of his market timing on astrological factors or principles.
Several years ago, I had the good fortune to talk on the telephone on several occasions 
with a former associate of W.D. Gann’s. Because of a promise to keep his identity a secret, 
I can’t tell you his name. But, he lived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and his initials are R.C. 
R.C. ‘s father was a very good astrologer and had worked with Gann. When R.C. was a young 
man, he followed in his father’s footsteps and started working with Gann. He worked with 
Gann on a full-time basis as a partner and collaborating astrologer for about ten years, from 
the late 1930’s to the late 1940’s.
During our conversations, R.C. told me that “rst and foremost, Gann was astrological.” 
He also said that during that period, he worked with Gann. Gann made most of his money by 
selling market letters and $5000 courses. In 1948, when Gann accurately forecast the top of the 
soybean market, almost to the penny and the minute, Gann sold one soybean futures contract 
short and rode it down one dollar for a gain of $5000.
This is a tribute to “Gann the man” but it does punch a hole in Gann, the fty mil lion 
dollar super genius trader. Of course, no trader is better than the system he uses. Was Gann 
a genius? Perhaps, but knowing that will neither help you trade nor help you learn the systems 
and perspectives Gann utilized. Were the systems Gann used ingenious? On that there is no 
doubt, the answer is a resounding yes. Gann was successful because he had the benet of 
thousands of years of ancient principles on his side, of which he was a relentless student. If 
you are still skeptical about W.D. Gann using astrology, I have included a chart of May soybean 
futures used by Gann. A copy of this same chart also appears on page 202 of P.J. Kaufman’s 
1978 book, Commodity Trading Systems and Methods. I mention this so that you can see for 
yourself that I did not in anyway alter this chart. Now, please refer to this chart. In the upper left 
hand corner you will nd “May Soybeans.” Follow the vertical line down, which goes through the 
yin May (three horizontal lines). There you should nd a strange looking four, followed by a 30 
and an arrow like glyph. The strange looking four is the astrological/astronomical symbol glyph 
for the planet Jupiter. The 30 represents thirty degrees. The arrow like glyph is the symbol for 
the sign of Sagittarius (240 degrees). Gann was indicating that with Jupiter at thirty degrees 
of Sagittarius, 240 degrees plus 30 degrees equals 270 degrees, there should be important 
support/resistance at a price of 270.
There is another Jupiter glyph on the left side of the chart near the price of 264 on the 
price scale, with a dotted, jagged line extending up and to the right. The dotted line plots the 
movement of Jupiter. Directly to the right of this last Jupiter glyph, below the “a” in Soybeans, 
you will nd a small circle with an arrow on top, the symbol for the planet Mars. This is followed 
by “22”, and the arrow like the glyph for Sag

Fibonacci to the Bank 
By Robert Miner
Gann and Elliott market analysis ranges from the practical to the highly esoteric. From my 
point of view, any theory of the marketplace is of value only if it can be put into practical 
use. Whether a theory or technique is valid is based solely on whether its consistent 
use enables the trader or investor to prot consistently in his business of speculation. Gann 
and Fibonacci analysis is the basis of my time and price ratio analysis. Elliott wave analysis 
is the basis of the price pattern analysis.
My approach to investing and trading using Gann, Elliott, and Fibonacci analysis is three 
dimensional. These three dimensions are time, price, and pattern. Only when time, price, and 
pattern coincide do I consider the market in a position to offer a sufciently low risk trading 
opportunity to enter the market. I’ll describe how I analyzed recent market activity in gold using 
these time, price, and pattern techniques to enter actual trades.
There were many long term time price, and pattern indications that a major change in trend 
was likely in the gold market in the December 1987 January 1988. The gold rally cycle from 
the February 1985 low did indeed reach nal top on December 14 and prices moved down 
sharply from there. By identifying the completion of a major bullish cycle, the trader can begin to 
determine the parameters of time, price, and pattern to trade the correction.
Once a major or minor cycle is complete, I always look for a ABC or three wave correction 
at a minimum. The market may unfold into a more complex correction. By following strict rules 
that require particular time, price, and pattern parameters to be satised and coincide, I nd I 
can consistently enter the market at a very minimum risk and catch the larger swings. The rst 
corrective wave from the December high unfolded in a clear Elliot ve- wave pattern. Prices 
corrected approximately 38.2% of the February 1985 - December 1987 rally. The nal week 
of the ve-wave corrective pattern resulted in a reversal week with a new low and a close 
considerably above the previous weeks close. The A-wave was not complete and the trader’s 
objective is not to determine the parameters to enter the direction of the trend on the short side 
to take advantage of the next wave down or the C-wave.
I will begin the detailed analysis with the market activity subsequent to the A-wave bottom 
of February 29. The market could unfold in a more complex corrective pattern than an ABC 
correction. The A-wave low of February 29 could result in the nal price low of the correction. 
I usually go under the assumption that there will be a second corrective wave down from any 
extended rally. This is particularly true when a major time cycle has completed which was the 
case with the top in gold in December. The objective is to enter the market on the short side with 
minimum risk and take all the market will give us. Since the rst leg of the correction resulted in a 
clear Elliott ve-wave pattern in the February low, I would look for the B-wave to unfold in a ABC 
pattern. The completed B-wave is likely to correct either 38.2% or 50% of the A-wave. The A-wave 
correction was $101 (December 88 contract): December 14 high at 542 to February 29 low at 
441. A 38.2% corr

short of the projected 38.2% corrective level at 480. Seven weeks is 49 calendar days. Gann 
called any time interval of 49 the “death zone” and a period to prepare for a change of trend. 
Prices had unfolded in an ABC pattern of sorts into the 49th day at April 18. This appeared to 
be an ideal shorting opportunity. Prices were at a signicant Fibonacci price retracement level 
exactly at the completion of an important Gann time cycle and Elliott corrective pattern. Time, 
price, and pattern had coincided. The weakest dimension at this point in time was the Elliott 
pattern analysis. The price pattern was not the clear Elliott ABC correction I’ve come to anticipate 
in the gold market and the precision of the coincidence of time and price overruled the Elliot 
pattern doubts. I looked for a conrmation of a top to short the market.
I went short on the close two days later on April 20. Price activity on April 20 resulted in a 
fairly wide ranging outside day where prices closed near the low of the day and below the prior 
day’s low. This was strong conrmation that the rally cycle from the February low had likely 
topped. I’m now short at 473.50. My stop was placed at 481. Just two days later prices moved 
down $8 and the stop was lowered to 475. So far so good. A small rally ensued the following 
week with prices failing to ll the gap left on April 22. On May second, when prices exceeded 
the rst short term swing low of April 26, I moved the stop down 466 close only, just above the 
small gap left May second. This insures me of at least a small prot. I’m looking for a longer 
term C-wave correction which should extend at least $50 or 1/2 of the A-wave. I’m stopped 
out the following week on May 10 at 466 when the market closed right at my close stop. I 
now have a $7.50 prot ($750 per contract) in three weeks. I’ll take it with no complaints. 
However, I’m looking for a larger swing.
Gann reiterates throughout his work that time is the most important element. A market will 
not complete a trend until the time is up. At this point in time, it did not appear that the seven 
week cycle completed the B-wave correction. Now I must determine when the next most likely 
time for this phase of the correction is likely to end.
N/lay 29 would be 90 days from the February 29 low. The week beginning May 30 would be 
three months from the Feb. 29 low. Gold very often has a change in trend upon the completion 
of one of Gann’s natural time cycles of 30, 60,90, and 180 interval periods. I would look at 
the week beginning May 30 as a high probability change in trend period and a likely time to 
expect the completion of the B-wave cycle.
One June second, gold had the widest range day in months and broke out of the triple top 
at the important 38.2% retracement level of 480. A breakout above a triple top usually indicates 
and results in an explosive rally. I didn’t trust this breakout. In the larger picture the correction 
from the December 1987 top did not look complete. The week of the breakout completes the 
90-day and three month cycle and strongly indicates a likely high and completion of the B-wave 
cycle. Just one day following the June third breakout results in a strong indication the breakout is

462, just about the most recent swing high and anticipate the market will move sharply lower 
following this breakdown. A bid disappointment results as the market immediately rebounds 
back above the double bottom. The market essentially moves sideways over the next two weeks 
with another move below the recent lows with still no follow thru.
This brings us up to the time this is being written (mid-Aug.). I’m protably short from 
476 with my stop at 462,  this insures a $l4 prot ($l400 per con-tract). However, I’m in the 
market for the larger moves. Price, time and pattern activity do not yet suggest the move is 
over. Let’s take a brief look at what we might expect in the weeks ahead and the parameters 
for time, price, and pattern activity.
Pattern Objectives: In a normal ABC correction to an extended rally, the C-wave will be 
lower than the A-wave low and in a proportion relating to the A-wave. Prices have barely 
exceeded the February lows and have not yet reached the minimum price objectives for the 
completion of the C-wave. It is likely there will still be lower prices before the completion of 
the C-wave cycle. What if the correction for the December high is going to unfold in a longer 
term Elliot 5 wave pattern and the June top is just the completion of wave two. If this is the 
case, much lower prices can be expected. That’s ne by me. I’m short from near the June 
high and will take all the market will give.
Price Objectives: The 418-423 zone is the rst level of major support below the double 
bottom near 440. The A-wave = 101. 61.8% x 101 from the B-wave top at 485 = 423. The June 
3 high at 461 less the June 29 low at 442 = 43. July 21 high at 461 less 43 = 418. This important 
price support zone coincides with the longer term support trendline on the spot continuation 
weekly chart in the August time period. The next major support level lies at 396-397. A 61.8% 
retracement of the February 85 -December 87 rally is at 397. That rally lasted 146 weeks. 
December 87 high at 542 (December 88 contract) less 146 = 396. The nal major level of 
support and most likely the maximum extent of the C-wave is at 384 where the C-wave would 
equal the A-wave. B-wave high at 485 less 101 = 384.
Time Objectives: Week beginning August 8 = 180 weeks from the February 85 low and 34 
weeks from the December 87 high. Week beginning August 15 = 60 weeks from the June 87 
low, 35 weeks from the December 87 high and 24 weeks from the February 88 low. Week of 
August 22 = 100 weeks from the September 86 high. Week of August 29 = six months from the 
February 88 low. February 27 = 180 calendar days from the February 29 low. These are all Gann 
and Fibonacci natural time cycles plus the 35 interval period cycle for gold. Gold’s price was $35 
for years. 35 is an important time and price vibration interval for gold.
The month of August and particularly August 25 completes an important Gann and Fibonacci 
time cycle for gold. On August 25, 1976 gold reached a very important low of $100. From that 
point gold entered a relentless rally into the 1980 high. August is 144 months (12 x 12) or 
12 years from that important low. I will look for a minor or major change in trend in the last 
two weeks of August. If the

By Marcus Robinson
Before we embark upon a dissertation on our interpretation of the valid Elliott Wave 
count, let us briey review this complex work so that we may provide ourselves with 
some common understanding of this intricate market theory. The Wave Theory was 
developed by R.N. Elliott to explain the aggregate decisions made in the markets at large. In 
short, the theories suggest that prices follow a basic eight-wave pattern, an impulse pattern of 
ve advancing waves in the direction of the prevailing price trend and three corrective waves, 
retracing the price action of the impulse wave. There are additional triangular and rectangular 
price formations which are more complex in nature than those of the impulse or corrective variety, 
but nonetheless serve as trading sequences within the basic pattern.
Our interpretation of the wave count in the Swiss Franc is as follows: Our preferred count 
suggests that minor wave ve of primary wave ve peaked late last year on December 31 at 
75.55 basis the nearest futures contract. The ensuing price pattern in a downward impulse 
wave (a ve-waves down pattern) which is now in the process of putting in the price low of 
intermediate wave three of minor wave A (see gure 1).
Our interpretation in the U.S. Dollar Index is a perfect mirror image of the wave count we’ve 
provided for the Swiss Franc. The reasoning behind this phenomena is that we view the role of 
both markets as being quite similar in the overall currency markets. In our view, the Swiss Franc 
is in itself a basket of currencies’ as is the Dollar Index because, as is well known, the Swiss 
are the bankers of the world. The Swiss Franc, on one hand, is backed partially by gold and by 
an international banking system which literally serves as the ultimate bank vault for the Western 
world. The U.S. Dollar Index was specically designed to reect the value of the greenback 
in terms of the world currencies from the economically advanced western world. We feel the 
comparison is worthy to note and is one of the reasons we have isolated these two markets as 
the major focus of our efforts in the currency markets.
As the theory goes, traders should expect to see a corrective rally emerge from here which 
will eventually give way to another ve-waves down pattern which will be correctly labeled 
intermediate wave ve of minor wave A.
From this low, we may expect a good sized advance. Since this will be a corrective wave it 
will be correctly counted as a three-wave advance. Once this upside correction completes itself 
(labeled intermediate wave B), traders should then be prepared for a spectacular decline into our

three of a bull market advance. Under this scenario, the recent decline can be correctly 
counted as an A-B-C type fourth-wave correction of the recent advance. This count would 
be very bullish as it would assert that another impulse wave of minor degree  (very powerful) 
lies directly ahead.

old bear market was put in last December, registering a low of 85.55 basis the cash contract. 
The recent rally that we’ve heard so much about is the emergence of a new bull market in the 
U.S. Dollar. Minor wave one put in a high of 92.50 last February resulting in a wave two pull back 
into May of this year. The recent upturn that we’ve seen in the market of late is intermediate 
wave three of primary wave one of the new bull market in the dollar. The wave three rally is 
currently in progress and should peak by no later than late October or early November. This 
should make for some pretty good political news given the presidential election this year. Once 
wave three is completed traders should see a sizeable decline in the value of the dollar as most 
major cycles turn down going into next year (see gure 4).
Our alternative scenario calls for an A-wave peak of A-B-C type counter trend rally to be 
put in here, then a brief pullback into late September (to form a B-wave low). Then traders 
should see a nal thrust upward into late October/early November to put in the C wave high. 
Once this corrective trading cycle is complete, traders should see another sizeable decline in 
the Dollar emerge as we bring in the new year.
One of the unique characteristics of our trading model is that it produces exact price and 
time projections using a proprietary form of analysis which includes many of the price and time 
calculations of W.D. Gann and Leonardo Fibonacci de Pisa. Before we bombard you with a choice 
selection of the projections our system has generated, let us review some of the background 
information and formulas which were useful in developing our model.
The basic assumption of numerical systems based upon the work of Leonardo Fibonacci 
is that everything is relative. Not only is it relative, our interpretation of his work asserts that 
the relativity of price and time can be accurately expressed in terms of a ratio. The Fibonacci 
ratios we use most commonly are: .382, .50, .55, .618, and .892. We sometimes use the 
ratios of 1.382, 1.50, 1.55, 1.618, etc. for extended forecasts. A basic application of these 
ratios would be to multiply the measured range of a particular price advance to nd its most 
probable retracement low or to determine the exact time periods for high probability turning 
points in the markets as well.
Before getting into the specic technologies we use in developing our prole, we would like 
to lay a little ground work to establish some basic mutual understanding. We acknowledge the 
existence of natural cycles which have certain affects on our planet, human thought, and emotion 
and thus affecting human behavior (the aggregate of which determines market dynamics). 
Probably a less intimidating approach to this subject is to rename it “cycle analysis” and right 
away there would be a body of cyclical data upon both, for our purposes they are equally which 
we could all agree. There are valid.” The basic difference between several important cycles 
which we the two systems is that heliocentric could easily translate into a planetary movement

the 45 Degree Angle
By Peter A. Pich
After several years of conversations on our customer support line, I have found some 
common misunderstandings that seem to be shared by a number of Gann students. 
One of them has to do with Gann’s lXl, 2X1, 4X1 angles and their relationship with 
the 45 angle.
In Gann’s lesson Geometric Angles he describes the 450 or IXI angle as follows: “The 
rst and most important angle to draw is a 450 angle or a moving trend line that moves up 
one cent per week or I cent per month” Throughout his course material he uses the terms “45 
degree line” and “lXl line” interchangeably.
In today’s markets these terms are seldom the same. When Gann wrote his books and 
courses he traded the soybean market. His charts were scaled at one cent per price division so 
that a 1XI line and a 45 line were physically the same angle. In to days soybean market a chart 
would need to be scaled at four or eight cents per price division in order to make the chart a 
practical size to t on your desk. The important term is not 450 line but rather a line that moves 
up a rate of one cent per day, week, or month. A more descriptive term would be “True 450 or a 
lXl angle that is adjusted for the scale of the chart. On a soybean chart with a scale of 4 cents per 
division the True 450 would have a physical angle as measured with a protractor, of 140. (Tangent 
of 1/4) The line would rise at a rate of one quarter price division per time division. Since the price 
division has a scale of four cents, the one cent per day requirement is satised.
When the PRICES WITH SQUARES module is used in the Ganntrader I software program 
the physical shape of the plotted square is automatically adjusted for the scale of the chart. For 
example, a Square of 144X144 on a chart with a four cent scale would be one fourth as tall as 
its length. The True 450 always runs from one corner of the square to the opposite corner. You 
can over-ride this feature by simply multiplying the price portion of the square by the scale of 
the chart. This will produce a physically square.
Another often asked question is what constitutes a one cent movement for markets and that 
aren’t quoted in cents? The T-Bonds, currencies and S&P 500 are the three examples.
Using a full point in the bonds such as from 86-12 to 87-12 as the basis for the lXl angle is 
not very practical. A full point represents 32 X $31.50 or $1000 which is too large a number for 
an angle that is supposed to rise one point per day, week or month. I have found that treating 
the 1/32 ticks as the price portion of the IXI angles works well if the entire price is plotted in 1/32 
ticks. The Ganntrader I program allows you to multiply the price by any number prior to plotting. 
Multiplying a bond Quote of 86-12 by 32 produces a tick number of 2764. (86 times 32 plus 12 
= 2764) These numbers make a better t with Gann’s square of 90 and 144. Often you’ll nd 
the major highs and lows are multiples of 90 ticks apart.
Commodities, such as the currencies, that are quoted as fractions of a cent should have their 
decimal point shifted to the right prior to plotting. The program was designed for experimentation 
so it is a simple matter to try several decimal point shifts until the correct one is found. For 
example, Swiss Francs at $6500 sho

as the price value in the True 45 angle. The S&P 500 is quoted in ve point increments. 
The True 450 angle might be one that rises at a rate of ve points or 50 points per day, 
week or month.
Gann often charted Eggs using a scale of 13 points per price division. I don’t know if this 
is related to the minimum price uctuation of that market or if he had some other reason. 
The charts I’ve seen have 450 angles drawn on them. With a scale of 13 per division these 
angles rise at a rate of 13 points per day.
In his Cotton Course he describes the 450 or lXl angle as follows: “The rst and always that 
most important angle to draw is a 450 angle or a moving average that moves up 10 points per 
day, 15 points per week or 20 points per month”. This statement would seem to contradict this 
rule of I unit of price per time unit is a IXI angle. For the cotton market these numbers must have 
proven to be the correct point values to be the True 450 angle.
As a rule you will know when you have the True 450 angle when the prices in a normal 
Bull or Bear market follow it up and down. You should see occasional price moves above 
the 450 angle to the 2X1 and below it to the IX2. When you have found the True 450 angle 
for that particular market.

You may also want to try to experimenting with using the minimum price fluctuation 
as the price value in the True 45 angle. The S&P 500 is quoted in five point increments. 
The True 450 angle might be one that rises at a rate of five points or 50 points per day,

Part l
By Chuck Carpino
This article will review some of the predictions of W.D. Gann that were made in his Annual 
Forecasts. The Forecasts for 1919 to l922 can be found in his The Truth of the Tape. His 
1929 Forecast is from the 1930 Wall Street Stock Selector. Gann’s prediction method 
was unique because he attempted to provide his subscribers with specic trend forecasts, 
extreme high or low points, and bull or bear cycle swings. The fact that Gann did this for over 
four decades, could provide written testimonials, and audited brokerage statements of his prots 
is a tribute to his forecasting genius. As I review some of his forecasts, you should always keep 
in mind that they were prepared a year in advance.
In his Forecasts, Gann prepared a Stock Curve as well as a Railroad Curve when it was 
necessary. The Stock Curve was made up of 20 industrial stocks of his day and I suspect it 
deviated off its projected path more than the Railroad Curve. The reason is because there are 
so many industrial groups in the 20 stocks that news events of a major breakthrough in one 
or two industries would send those stocks up while the general trend should be falling, and it 
altered the curve. The same reasoning would apply as to why his grain and cotton forecasts 
seem much more accurate than his stock forecasts on a month to month basis. In making up 
his stock forecast, he considered his Curve for Interest Rates and the various commodities 
he tracked. This was probably to obtain some guide as to the inationary pressures of his 
time. He then came up with an interpretation of their interaction, along with his numerous 
other methods, he built an annual forecast as to the general trend and strongest up or down 
months as he saw them.
Probably his most famous prediction was that of the 1929 bull market top which he 
accurately forecasted in late 1928. He correctly forecasted the bull move into the summer 
of 1929 and figured late March would mark the low in stocks. Actually, the base for the 
bull market stretched until May 27th before really commencing an upward move. However, 
March 26th was an important low just as he said it would be. You would have made money 
buying your stocks here. He correctly called for a distribution top during the summer months 
of July and August.
He said for September, One of the sharpest declines of the year is indicated. A Black 
Friday is forecasted and a panicky decline in stocks with only small rallies. Extreme high for the 
month around September 2nd to 3rd and a low around September 27th to 28th from which a fair 
sixed rally and a trading market running into the early part of November. After that, the big bear 
campaign will again get under way and stocks will continue to work lower, reaching extreme low 
for the year around Dec. 23rd to 24th.’ Let’s compare this prediction with the actual results. The 
exact date of the top in the industrials occurred on September 3rd at 386 and a vicious decline 
commenced. He did provide his clients with important advice - get out by late August. A nice 
entry point for shorts was also given as September 3rd. Unfortunately, if you has tried to short 
in early August, as he thought the highs would occur here, you would have suffered losses in 
the sharp August advance of 1929 (like August 1987)

advantage over having a reversal date and waiting for prices to indicate the current trend before

work out, but alas, no system is perfect and neither was Gann’ s curve for the fall of 1929 correct 
on all points. A small bottom occurred on October 4th, not September 27th - 28th (this could 
be hazardous if prices are in a big decline, which they were) and mounted only a minor rally to 
October 11th before continuing their descent to 195 on Nov. 13, 1929. The nal low was made 
here, not December 23rd. Take a closer look at what did occur on December 23rd. From a high 
point on December 23rd, making a higher low at a price level not to be seen again for another 
seven months. As you can see, his date for a low came in nicely, but it was a higher low. I have 
found it very difcult in prediction to determine if a second low is a nal one, a double low, or a 
higher low. It seems you have to let prices dictate that to you.
Here’s another one of his forecasts where he was very specic. In December 1920, he 
issued his 1921 Forecast in which he said, “The bull campaign top for the Spring culminates 
between April 28th to May 3rd. The month of May indicates serious declines.” He had June as 
being dull and inactive. In actuality, the yearly top was at 80.03 on May 5th, with May 2nd - May 
5th almost at the same price levels. By the end of May, prices had declined in a steady fashion to 
73.44 and made a nal low at 64.90 on June 20th. This was a Forecast which correctly got you 
out of your long and short positions at the right time for a long monthly decline.
What is most interesting about his work is that without price information, he was predicting 
the trend and identifying the dates of tops or lows, and doing it a year in advance. He wasn’t 
always right, but when you look at his high accuracy ratio, you begin to understand what he 
meant by “Once you know the cause of market movements, you can predict the effect, long 
before Wall Street is aware of either.”

via
Astrology
By Carol S. Mull
The market moves through periods of optimism, expansion, anxiety, depression, and panic, 
as dictated by the magnetic winds that govern the universe. These periods are known as 
economic cycles. Some economic cycles last for centuries, while others have a duration 
of only a few minutes, hours, or days. It is possible to obtain approximate market predictions 
via analyzing these sequences and projecting them forward, but more accurate predictions 
can be produced through astrology.
Astrology requires the exact computation of when and where the planetary bodies 
will reach exact aspects such as 900, 1 80~, I 200 from one another. Correlations have 
been found between planetary aspects and economics cycles. Today the theory that the 
magnetic forces generated by planetary aspects cause cycles is gaining acceptance by 
cyclic theorists and astrologers.
Like all astrological forecasting, nancial astrology does not yield exact results, but its study 
can give indications that have a high degree of probability. The best results of all can be obtained 
when astrology is combined with the usual fundamental/technical methods.
Sun/Moon Aspects
The astrological aspects that are the easiest to learn and use are those between the sun and 
moon (these can be found in an almanac). Sun/moon aspects are so important to the market that 
you can be correct about 80 percent of the time if you use only this type of aspect.
The sun and moon are conjunct at the new moon, and unless overshadowed behavior 
aspects, the market can be expected to move upward at that time. The sun and moon are in 
square aspect (90 0) at the rst quarter and last quarter, and a bear market is the normal result. 
The sun and moon are in opposition (1800) at the full moon, which usually brings a somewhat 
bullish market, but is not as positive as the new moon.

quarter; they are indicators of bull markets.
Since aspects cast their inuences before them, the expected effect will usually come the 
day before the aspect is exact. When it does reach exactness, it is all over.
Sunspots
Periods of solar prominence (sunspots) pour forth energy, causing all earthly activities to 
increase-including stock market trading. The usual result of this stimulus is a major market 
turning point, either up or down.
Increased sunspot activity occurs whenever the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter 
are on the same side as the earth. The greatest inuence of all this tidal-like force occurs when 
Jupiter and Venus are in a helio-centric line-up with the earth at 0~, 450, and 900, but lesser 
activity produces the well-known Dow cycles of 89 weeks, 124 weeks, and 208 weeks.
A very good illustration of this market indicator occurred last October 19 when the market 
dropped 505 points. Jupiter was exactly opposite the sun, increasing solar ares and market 
timing-thus forcing a turning point.
So, be aware that aspects to the sun mark major market turning points, both up and 
down. For exact timing, you will need to construct a helio-centric chart. Most computer 
programs have this option.
The Total Picture-Positive or Negative
Another valuable tool in short-term market forecasting is to tally all the aspects in the sky on 
a given day. This method was originated by David Williams, author of Financial Astrology, but I 
have altered his method somewhat. What I do is list the aspects that are within a degree of orb 
on a given day over New York City within market hours, plus the more important ones that fall 
after or before the market is open. I then assign a numerical value to each aspect: Conjunctions 
are ten, sextiles are three, trines ten, and oppositions six. In general, conjunctions, sextiles, 
and trines are positive, while squares and oppositions are negative, but this can be overridden 
by the nature of the planets involved. Saturn and Mars are always negative; Jupiter, Venus, 
and the sun are always positive.
When my list is complete I simply add my negative column, and then my positive column. 
If I have -84 and +15, I denitely expect a down-day at the market. Plus 64 and minus 16 
would indicate a bull market.
This method of analysis works because it is an overall indication of how the majority 
of people will be feeling. If the populace is feeling depressed and fearful (Saturn/Neptune), 
they are apt to sell their stock.
Most Ephemeris’s (catalog-type books listing all the planetary positions at Midnight by noon] 
at Greenwich, England on a daily basis) have an aspectarian section. Or computer programs are 
available. Or ‘Dell Horoscope” magazine carries a aspectarian section in each issue.
This same method of tally aspects can be used on an hourly basis, or even fifteen 
minutes.
Another interesting experiment is to run charts for New York City for every half-hour for a 
given market day. Then, armed with your sixteen charts, sit back and watch the ticker tape. The 
sun, Mercury, and Venus will be in the mid-heaven around noon each day, which will produce 
a slight but noticeable rally. When Uranus is in the Midheaven, the market will be erratic; 
Saturn will

midheaven on a minute-by minute basis.
Mars aspects
The planet Mars acts as a “trigger” for certain undesirable long term stock market 
movements, whenever this planet is square or opposes one of the outer planets. In fact, the 
stock market is 70 percent likely to develop a downward trend whenever Mars is in conjunction 
with one or more outer planets and simultaneously pattern is not alleviated by trines and sextiles. 
The orb for the square should be 50, but 80 can be allowed for the opposition. The following 
aspects are especially bad for the market: Mars conjunct Saturn, Mars square Neptune, Mars 
opposite Jupiter, Mars in opposition--regardless of the planet. All Martian retrograde stations 
should be regarded as critical to the market. In contrast, stock prices have consistently risen 
during the thirty days just before a conjunction of Mars with Jupiter or Mercury.
January and September Highs
The market is usually up January 9th through the 18th. This is because the sun reaches 
23-25 Capricorn in mid-January, which produces a grand trie with Mercury at 24 Tarus 
in the New York Stock Exchange chart, sun at 26 Taurus in the NYSE chart, seventh 
house cusp of NYSE chart, Neptune at 20 Virgo in the chart of the U.S.A., and Pluto at 24 
Capricorn in the chart of the U.S.A. A similar effect happens each September when transit 
sun reaches 18-27 Virgo.
Retrograde Mercury
The planet Mercury rules trade and commerce as well as communication. Whenever it is in 
retrograde motion the market becomes sluggish, listless.
Eclipses
Eclipses bring an erratic, unpredictable market while they are overhead. Then, for about six 
months afterwards, that spot in the sky is sensitized. Whenever another planet, especially Mars, 
comes into aspect with that point, the market is likely to fall sharply.
Conclusion
I think of astrology as neither an art nor a science, but as a discipline. That is, it works in 
the same way that medicine, jurisprudence, and the ministry work. There is a body of principals 
and laws at the core of astrology, but these must be in the hands of a skilled and experienced 
astrologer who exercises capable judgement for good results. Like medicine, law, and theology, 
astrology may not always give quantiable results--but it works, nonetheless.
If you wish to use it for market prediction, you should rst learn the fundamentals. Since

Markets
By Kevin K. LaRocca, CTA
Anyone who has studied the commodity market for a period of time has had an underlying 
sense of an order to the market, but they have fallen short because their approaches 
limited their scope of the full picture. Most of these approaches have exposed portions of 
this order, but have failed to reveal the complete picture.
In the past few years a new breakthrough in scientic technology has been developed, 
enabling us to accomplish such a feat. This major breakthrough is the science of holography.
The word ‘holography’ is derived from the words “holo” (complete) and “gram” (message). 
As the above words indicate, holograms capture, through a pictorial process, all the visual 
aspects of an object. In other words, it presents objects in a three-dimensional photographic 
format. A standard photograph, in comparison, merely collapses a three-dimensional object 
into a two-dimensional plane.
It is through the characteristics of this unique photographic process that we are able to 
expose the true order behind all market movement. In order to understand how holography is 
utilized to predict future turning points in the markets, we must rst examine the characteristics 
of a hologram.
Holography is different than traditional methods of three-dimensional presentation because 
it utilizes laser technology. It is a simple process of photography recording the patterns formed 
by two interfering sets of light waves that are reected off of an object. One of these must be a 
reference wave. It is this reference wave source that will nally be used to reconstruct for the 
viewer the originally recorded scene. These interfering sets of light waves are recorded on a 
special plate designed to capture and record the waves at the angles at which they are reected. 
By simply shining the reference laser through the negative plate, the original wave patterns 
are reconstructed and the object is once again seen in its three-dimensional form. Without the 
proper light source, the negative plate appears as a meaningless pattern of swirls. Only with the

characteristic of a hologram is that the whole image can be seen through any of its individual 
parts. For instance, if one were to view a hologram of a horse, and were to cut one portion 
of the horse (ie, leg) and then enlarge that section to the original size, one would not see an 
enlarged leg, but instead, a picture of the whole horse. Like the negative plate of a hologram, 
the action of the commodity and stock markets seem to be a picture of intermingling wave 
patterns and, like holography, there are also two distinct light (wave) sources which govern 
their behavior. These two sources remain constant, and will never change, for without them, 
there would be no price uctuations.
Once it becomes clear what these two light sources are, we then have the ingredients 
to reconstruct a hologram of the commodity and stock markets. Like the negative plate of 
a hologram, the true order of the markets can be brought into view only through the use of 
the proper reference wave. That is, order, from what appeared to be disorder. As a result 
of this methodology, we are now able to observe the markets in three-dimensional format 
which not only exposes their patterns, but also where all major and minor turning points 
will occur in the future. We also know whether it will be a top or a bottom. It is essentially 
a window into time.
Just like a hologram, we do not need the complete historical price action for a particular 
market, in order to nd the pattern. Through a specialized process, I am able to take a small 
segment of the price action of a particular market and reconstruct the complete pattern. Once 
this pattern is found, it should remain constant, no matter how far into the future we go. Figure 
1 is a weekly chart of heating oil prices from 1983 to January, 1986. The lines super-imposed 
on the chart represent my predicted turning points for this designated time period. As you can 
see, on this weekly chart, my predicted turning points occurred within a few weeks of the actual 
turning point. This shows the trend direction and the duration of the move. In order to narrow 
in on the actual day that a turning point will occur, I will apply the holographic process to a 
daily chart, as shown below in Figure 2.
On the weekly chart (Fig. 1), I predicted a top to occur on November 22, 1985. Knowing 
that I would be close to within a few weeks for that predicted point, I would look for a top 
during that time period on my daily chart (Fig. 2). This predicted point also occurred on 
November 22, 1985. The actual top in the heating oil occurred on November 23, 1985. By 
applying the holographic process, I was able to predict, within one trading day, when a major 
top in the heating oil would occur.

### Deep Analysis — Gann Short-Term Market Forecasting via Astrology

**Multiple Authors / Compilation:**

1. **Biblical Cycles:**
   - 1260 days = 3.5 prophetic years (Daniel, Revelation)
   - 2520 days = 7 prophetic years = the Great Cycle
   - 3.5 years × 360 days/year = 1260 days
   - These cycles appear in major market tops and bottoms
   - Gann's "Master Time Factor" is built on 2520

2. **Saros Eclipse Cycles:**
   - Saros period = 6585.33 days = 18 years, 11 days, 8 hours
   - Eclipses repeat at Saros intervals
   - Markets show correlated behavior at Saros intervals from major events
   - Triple Saros (Exeligmos) = 54 years, 33 days — matches Gann's 54-year cycle

3. **Granville Cooley's Gann-Fibonacci Connection:**
   - **Master Numbers:** Cooley identified that Gann's key numbers (144, 360, etc.) and Fibonacci numbers share deep structural relationships
   - **Death Zone:** The area on the SQ9 between specific angular positions where harmonic support breaks down
   - **Great Cycle of Enoch:** 364 days (52 weeks exactly) — Enoch's solar calendar, close to 360° circle
   - Cooley showed that the Fibonacci sequence, when placed on the SQ9, reveals hidden geometric patterns

4. **Range Expansion (Toby Crabel):**
   - NR4 (Narrow Range 4): when today's range is the narrowest of the last 4 days
   - NR7 (Narrow Range 7): narrowest range in 7 days
   - After range contraction, expect range expansion (breakout)
   - Combined with Gann time cycles: when a time cycle date coincides with NR4/NR7, the breakout direction is predicted by the cycle

5. **Astrological Timing:**
   - Major planetary aspects (conjunction, opposition, square, trine) create market turning points
   - Faster planets (Moon, Mercury, Venus) = short-term timing
   - Slower planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) = long-term cycles
   - Ingresses (planet entering new sign) = trend changes
   - Retrograde stations = reversals

**Key Insight:** Short-term forecasting combines planetary aspects for timing with Gann's angular mathematics for price targets. The most reliable signals occur when multiple methods converge — a time cycle date + planetary aspect + price at SQ9 level + range contraction pattern.
