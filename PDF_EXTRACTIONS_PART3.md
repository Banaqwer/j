A Time and Price Cycle Analysis
"To make a success in trading stocks you must get
the knowledge first; you must learn before you
lose. Many traders go into the stock market
without any knowledge and lose a large part of
their capital before they learn that it is necessary
to go through a period of preparation before they
start trading”

Introduction
Gann Cycles: Time and Price Analysis by Charles Shephard.
The combining of the time and price cycle calculation techniques used in this trading
system are thepracticalapplicationofWDGann’sstatementthat“whenyouknowhow
to use time and pricetogetheryouknowhowtotrade”.
As a market progress through TIME it will radiate,ortouseWDGann’sterm“vibrate”
from past high and low points waves into the future much like a pebble tossed into a
pond. The more important the high or low then the more important is the cycle. These
cycles or waves are fixed in their duration so can be calculated and projected into the
future. Gann stated in Tunnel thru the Air, “thatinorderto know and predict the future
of anything you only have to look up what has happened in the past and get a correct
baseorstartingpoint”and “…..ifyouhavethecorrectstartingpointandknowthe
cyclethatisgoingtoberepeated.”
As with time being measured from a past reference point, using the same cycles, so too
can price. When a time cycle and a price cycle meet this is where reversals occur. The
key to successful trading when using cycles is to coordinate price analysis with time
analysis so that when the cycles align on a particular date one can be prepared to take
advantage of the possible reversal in trend.
I have developed a system that integrates Time and Price cycles so that when they
intersect at points that are known in advance they will enable knowledge of exact dates
and prices to monitor for market reversals. The manner of their application is essentially
an extension of the already known techniques used by Gann traders but is greatly
superior as it enables precise calculation of potential reversal points to be made well in
advance by using information on the cycles that were not includedinGann’scommonly
available courses.
There are two primary cycles relied upon that Gann left information on. A third cycle is
a variation of one of the main two cycles. Each of the cycles can be calculated in
minutes, hours, days, solar degrees, weeks, months or years. When calculated in weeks
or larger time increments they tend to lose their exact day accuracy. These cycles when
divided into their parts as Gann instructed will give numerous intermediate high and
lows in the future. When major reversals occur there will always be one of these cycles
present.
ItisknownthatGann’scourseswereoftensoldtohisstudentswithpersonaltuitionalso
provided by him. It is likely that the additional knowledge of other cycle information
was revealed in this tuition. Consequently the original courses alone do not detail some
of the more powerful cycles used for time and price calculations and how to apply them.
One of the more accurate methods of determining a reversal point in price is by
knowledge of certain numbers that are derived from the main cycles. On a time cycle
date the moment a market reaches one of these numbers when ranging in price you will
be aware that is the point of reversal. This does not mean you will initiate a trade
immediately; you must wait for price action to confirm the analysis and to provide an
entry signal.
The more commonly known concepts of Gann, such as squaring time with price,
support and resistance levels and the swing chart are a suitable basis for this system to
```

Each of the techniques detailed in the following sections is aimed at determining these
points in time and price where a reversal may occur at. All market turns can be
accounted for using these techniques. It is likely impossible to be aware of them all in
advance as there are also numerous minor cycles that affect a market as it progresses
through time and price. Many of these cycles are also are detailed. It has been
endeavoured to isolate the most effective methods in developing this system to maintain
ease of application, consequently there are some techniques that once detailed are not
referred to again.
In my initial years as a trader I was intrigued by what caused the frequent high and low
points in markets. After years of study of WD Gann’s trading methods and by 
application of the information obtained from various sources to my hand drawn charts
which covered many years, certain things became apparent. Some of this information I
found explained Gann’s works to the extent that by knowledge of certain numbers and 
how to interpret them you “know” when reversals will occur. In my personal trading I
have traded numerous high and low points on the day they occurred, as well as many
intermediate swing turns in a trending market. One of these was exiting a short position
three points from a three hundred and seventy day bear market low.

be used with to determine which of the cycle dates are to be traded. The system is
suitable for intraday trading or entering positions as a market reacts on a cycle date at
the support or resistance levels by use of short time frame bars to indicate an entry point.
This allows for stops to be kept very close. The predetermined cycle dates are the key to
this method.
WDGann’sconceptsofdividingtime,priceandspaceisbasedonthepremisethat
everything moves in cycles or circles. A whole or 100% of a cycle in price or time is
where you start. These wholes are then divided by the Gann percentages. They can also
be used in multiples of the original whole. Where there are intersections of these whole
or part divisions is where resistance or support is located. As can be seen in the below
diagram where there is numerous intersections of these divisions of time, price and
space is where there is greater resistance or support.

Having the ability to determine tops and bottoms is one thing, to safely trade them is
another.Thesafestwaytotradeis“withthetrend”andyoumustalwaysusestoploss
orders. The importance of a markets trend cannot be underestimated. There are methods
described in this system that will forewarn of a change of trend, price action on the day
will confirm the reversal.
If you are not an experienced trader initially use this system to determine reversals
within an existing trend. Watch and learn from the factors present at the main highs and
lows before you trade them.
There are many systems available and some of them work well. There are Elliott wave
counts that are similar to Gann’ssectionsofthemarketandFibonaccinumbers that are
similar to Gannpricelevels.WDGann’smethodsshowwhymarketsworkthewaythey
do. These methods always work when properly applied. There have been occasions that
I have identified as a turning date and the market did not turn until the following day or
a day early. The reason for this was because I had overlooked other factors or made
inaccurate calculations. I learnt this information by making it my goal to understand
what was behind every swing turn on my charts.
The techniques shown in this manual when applied to the chart will show dates and
price levels that as the market works its way into these areas will enable you to form a
picture and be prepared for what is likely to follow. It is worth remembering that it is
best to regard these areas as signposts rather than impenetrable barriers. That is why
before entering a trade you must watch on the day for the reaction, this only needs to be
a higher swing low for long trades or a lower top for short trades using intraday charts.
To be successful as a trader you will need to have a distinct advantage over the market,
a plan to profit from that advantage and the discipline to apply that plan. The contents of
this manual will provide you with the distinct advantage. How you apply this
information is also described. How well you do this is for you to determine. This aspect
will determine your success or otherwise.
Acknowledgement must be given to WD Gann for his ability to have discovered the
reasons as to why markets turn when they do. It must also be remembered that he also
stated that the best way to trade was by swing trading.

The following is an extract from the WD Gann stock market course.
“TIMEisthemostimportantfactorindetermining market movements and by studying
the past records of the averages or individual stocks you will be able to prove for
yourself that history does repeat and that by knowing the past you can tell the future.
The ancient hunters had a rule that when they were searching to locate an animal in his
den they always followed his tracks backwards, figuring that it was the shortest route to
his lair. The quickest way for you to learn how to determine future market movements is
tostudythepast.“Thethingthat hath been, it is that which shall be; and there is no
newthingsunderthesun”.Eccl.1:9.
There is a definite relation between time and price. By a study of the time periods and
time cycles you will learn why tops and bottoms are formed at certain times and why
resistance levels are so strong at certain times and bottoms and tops hold around them.
Everything moves in cycles as a result of the natural law of action and reaction. By a
study of the past, I have discovered what cycles repeat in the future. There must always
be a major and a minor, a greater and a lesser, a positive and a negative. In order to be
accurate in forecasting the future, you must know the major cycles. The most money is
made when fast moves and extreme fluctuations occur at the end of major cycles.
The basis of my forecasting method
Mathematics is the only exact science. All power under heaven and earth is given unto
themanwhomastersthesimplescienceofmathematics.Emersonsaid,“Goddoes
indeedgeometrize”.Faradaysaid,“There is nothing in the universe but mathematical
pointsofforce”.Pythagoras,oneofthegreatestmathematiciansthateverlived,after
experimentingwithnumbersandfindingtheproofsofallnaturallaws,said,“Before
Godwasnumbers”.Hebelievedthat the vibration of numbers created God and the
Deity.Ithasbeensaid,“Figuresdon’tlie”.Menhavebeenconvincedthatnumberstell
the truth and that all problems can be solved by them.
The chemist, engineer and astronomer would be lost without the science of mathematics.
It is so simple and easy to solve problems and get correct answers and results with
figures that it seems strange so few people rely on them to forecast the future of
business, stocks and commodity markets. No matter whether you use geometry,
trigonometry or calculus, you use the simple rules of arithmetic. You do only two things,
you increase or decrease. WD Gann.
There are two kinds of numbers, odd and even. We add numbers together, which is
increasing. We multiply, which is a shorter way to increase. We subtract, which
decreases, and we divide, which also decreases. With the use of higher mathematics, we
find a quicker and easier way to divide, subtract, add and multiply, yet very simple
when you understand it
Everything in nature is male and female, white and black, harmony or inharmony, right
and left. The market moves only two ways, up and down. There are three dimensions
which we know how to prove width, length and height. We use three figures in geometry,
the circle, the square and the triangle. We get the square and triangle points of a circle
to determine point of time, price and space resistance. We use the circle of 360 degrees
to measure time and price.

Why most people lose in the markets.
The three main reasons the majority of people who trade in the markets lose money are;
1.
They over-trade or buy and sell too much for their capital.
2.
They do not place stop loss orders or limit their losses.
3.
Lack of knowledge. (This is the most important reason of all).
Most people buy stock because they hope it will go up and they will make profits. They
buy on tips or on what someone else thinks without any research of their own, they then
enter the market wrong and do not recognise their mistake or attempt to correct it until
it is too late. Eventually, they sell because they fear the stock will go lower still and then
they sell out at near the low levels. They do not realise that the stock market is a
business or a profession.
Why you need to learn to determine the trend of the market.
You may have tried to follow market advisory services and lost money or failed to make
profits. It is not wise to follow another persons lead even though they are right because
you cannot have the confidence to act on the advice when you do not know what it is
based on. You will be able to act with confidence and make profits when you can see
and know for yourself why markets should go up or down.
WD Gann.

To profitably trade the markets we want as much going our way as possible. As it is a
fact that more people lose in the markets than profit from them, than the obvious thing
is to select for trading markets that exhibit the characteristics that are conducive for
profitable trading. Trading is a probability business, timing is critical, but you will sleep
better if the markets you trade respond well to the points of support and resistance in
time and price that are calculated. You can take the best system but trade it in a poor
market and it will not do well.
Important points to consider are a markets daily range or price movement. There is little
point in tying up capital in a market that moves only a few points or cents per day.
Markets with sufficient liquidity or volume will ensure the spread or difference between
the buyers and sellers will not erode profits or add to losses at entry or exit.

Markets sometimes trend strongly ordon’ttrendatallforlengthyperiodsoftime.It’s
been saidthat“showmesomeonethat’smakingmoneyandI’llshowyouatrending
market”.Thisiswhatyouwant. The recommended trading scenarios in this manual will
ensure that entries are made very close to reversal points. From these reversal points is
often where the strongest moves begin.
There are those that search for markets that behave in certain ways or form particular
patterns, and those that focus on just a few markets patiently waiting for a trading signal.
Monitoring various markets can find you more trading opportunities, but getting to
know a market can have the advantage of getting a feel for that market.
Constantly switching between markets for can be confusing for some, specialising in
oneoronlyafewmarketscanleadto“pushing”trades. There are some markets that
reactions against the main trend are often to a particular level, or they are prone to false
breakouts, or they make clear moves or sometimes have large overnight gaps. Being
aware of market characteristics and your own personality type is important.
Often commodity markets trend better than do some stock indexes for example, because
their“value”isdeterminedbysupplyanddemandratherthanspeculation or rumour.
Gann believed commodities were easier to work with than were stocks.
Markets with ranges suitable for extracting a worthwhile profit from are important, as is
a market that exhibits in its chart pattern large overnight gaps advisable to stay away
from, as with the Nikkei shown above.
Costs in trading include minimum trading account size, brokerage fees, slippage and
with the recent introduction of Contracts for Difference, the interest payable on long
positions.
If you are in the United States and trading the Australian Share Price Index it would not
be practical unless you are nocturnal or are prepared to place limit orders.
Some exchanges that have overnight trading sessions will add that data to the previous
day or to the following day, and when calculating the precise day and degree
calculations explained in the cycle section, your calculations can be out by a day or even
three days. For example when a weekly turning point has occurred in a Friday nights
trading session but is added to the Monday’s data. Know your exchange and data
vendor’sinterpretationsofwhatyou may take for granted.
All markets at times can be volatile or trend well or are indecisive of their trend so when
looking for markets you wish to trade it is important to consider all these factors.
The chart on the following page is of a retail sector stock. The easiest money is made in
markets that trend in a reliable manner. On this chart note the swings on the way up and
down.Thisisasgoodasitgetsifusingamechanicaltradingsystem.The“swing
charts”sectiondetailsthismethod.
As simple as it may seem, using the swing chart for pattern and price information and
the daily bar chart for timing signals can be the most effective way to trade. This is what
Gannmeantwhenhestatedthat“swingtradingismostprofitable”.The following
chapters will show how to calculate price levels that the swing chart can react at. The
daily bar chart, by use of the time counts will show the time ranges and time cycles.
When these factors align, then a reversal is likely.

The highly emotional aspect of futures markets is what accounts for their conforming
well to the natural cyclical rhythms. The journey getting to the target dates and prices
can be volatile though. It is common for futures markets to routinely retrace up to 2/3rds
of their moves.
Today, it is relatively easy to trade individual stocks both for long and short positions
with recent trading products. If you are finding it difficult trading volatile futures
markets you may need to look at markets that trend more steadily.
Another factor to be considered with markets is the practical maintenance of a wall
chart that continually grows. At some stage it can become too cumbersome to use. A
market that trades within historical ranges that can be charted without having to add
new sections of chart paper above or below old highs and lows is more practical.
If you have studied Gann you would have come across the instructions he gave on
charting. He did say not to leave spaces for non trading days. It must be remembered
that markets traded 6 days each week in his time. He also stated that every few weeks to
leave spaces for the non traded days. This seems cumbersome. For the sake of
consistency it is best to use calendar days. This will become even more apparent as to
why, whenyougettothe“time counts’section.
```

### Page 12

Before trading in a stock or commodity an important factor that you need to look at is
the daily volume.
The daily volume is important as it determines at what price you can enter or exit a
market position. Markets that have low volume often have very large price swings.
These fluctuations are due to the laws of supply and demand. If there is only a few
available sellers of the market you want to buy, you are forced to pay what they want.
On the other hand, when you decide to sell, you may be forced to sell at a bid price not
closely matched with the most recent prices paid.
As low volume markets are traded by only a few, the market can easily be sold down
harder than markets that have higher volume it is also more easily “managed” going up.
“The driving power behind a market’s rise and fall is its volume. Volume shows 
whether supply or demand is increasing or decreasing. Monitoring the volume of sales
enables you to determine a change in trend.
At the end of a prolonged bull market or a rapid advance there is usually a large
increase in the volume of sales. After a sharp decline on heavy volume and a secondary
rally takes place with decreased volume, it is an indication that a final top has been
made.
If a market holds after making a second lower top and makes a narrow trading range
and then breaks out (down) on increased volume it is an indication of a further decline.
After a prolonged decline and the market is reaching bottom, the volume of trading
should decrease and the range in fluctuation should decline. This is a good indication
that liquidation is nearing an end and the market is about to show a change in trend.
After the first sharp advance when changing from a bear market to a bull market, a
market will have a secondary reaction and make a low just as it had a secondary rally
after the first sharp decline. If the volume of sales decreases on the reaction and then
the market moves up advancing on heavier volume it will be an indication of an
advance to higher levels.
Sales increase near the top and decrease near the bottom. The largest volume of sales
often comes before the final top is reached, that is, when the actual high is made. In
determining the extreme high and low points, monitor the market’s volume.

Close observation of“marketdepth”isveryusefulfortimingentriesandexits.Oftenas
a market progresses and encounters a resistance level or breaks to a new level it will
react one or two points or cents. Timing your entry to buy or sell after this reaction has
occurred as buying becomes greater will often see a trade not go against you at all.
This is particularly so when entering trades of the type described at the end of the
following section on swing charts.

“THE BEST WAY TO TRADE”The most money is made by swing trading, or in the
long pull trades, that is following a definite trend as long as the market trend is up or
down, you must learn by rules to wait until the market gets out of a rut or a trading
range. WD Gann
The swing chart or trend chart may be the most simple, yet effective method of
determining a markets’ trend. The construction of a swing chart results in what Gann 
called the Trend Indicator. The most common is the 1 day swing chart but he also
worked with the 2 day, 3 day and weekly swing charts as well as a “points” swing chart.
By using the 1 day swing chart in conjunction with a larger time frame swing chart,
such as the 2 day, or the 1 week swing chart you are able to see the minor trend and
main trend together. If you are a surfer, imagine riding a smaller wave with a larger
wave coming in from behind. The following chart of late 2004 in the S&P 500 shows
the daily bar chart, next is the 1 day swing chart, it shows a clearer picture and the 2 day
swing chart reveals a clearer view again.

Below is what Gann called a trend indicator line, drawn on the S&P 500
A pure swing trading system does not require you to have a separate bar chart as the
information can be taken from computer charts and the box style swing chart can be
hand drawn on a sheet of graph paper with the price scaling on the left side.
The box style swing chart has the advantage over a swing overlay or a trend line
indicator as it compresses the market action and clearly shows past levels where
swing turns have occurred. Where there are clusters of support or resistance levels,
then that will be an area of greater importance. This type of swing chart can easily
be hand drawn on a sheet of graph paper.

An“X”point’sswingchartdoesnottakeintoaccountthedailyorweekly time values,
it uses the price value of a trading range. You may have a trend that is showing 50
points or less retracements in a rising market, and then a retracement of 112 points may
occur. By using this larger retracement and ignoring lesser ones, until the next
retracement of similar amount to the 112 points occurs, you will have a larger
perspective of the trend.

How to construct a swing chart
To construct a 1 day swing chart start from a low point on a daily bar chart, use your
computer charting program to get the low price on this day. On a sheet of graph paper
with the price scale on the vertical axis at the left, draw a vertical line from the bottom
left, up to the high level at the last bar before there is a down day; that is a day that has a
lower low than the previous day. The line then moves down to that low and continues
vertically down to the low level of each bar on each successive down day. The line is
then swung up from the last low price at the day that has a high that is higher than the
previous day.
Using the below section of the S&P 500 daily bar chart to construct a 1 day swing chart
you draw a line connecting from 1 up to 2, from 2 down to 3 and from 3 up to 4 and so
on, until you reach 21.
Notethatpoint18isatan“outside”day,abarthathasbothahigher high and a lower
low than the previous day. The swing line goes to the high or low that occurred first in
the day. In this case it was the high.

The following diagram is what a swing chart would look like if the markets always
behaved in a typical manner. Markets do seek order and they achieve it. We must
recognize this if we are to profit.
Wave 1 is 100% of the range.
Wave 2 is a 50% retracement.
Wave 3 is a repeat of wave 1 or 100% of it.
Wave 4 is a 50% retracement again and the market is balanced, it has done the same
again as wave 1 and 2.
Wave 5 only does 75% of waves 1 and 3 so is weaker.
Wave 6 retraces more than the earlier retracements of 50% at 66.6% but has not
confirmed a lower top yet to indicate a change in trend.
Wave 7 attempts to take out the wave 5 high and fails, this forms lower swing top
when the next day trades lower this turns the direction of the swing chart down.
Wave 8 does 125% of wave 6 and finds support at a past support level.
Wave 9 retraces 62.5% of wave 8.
Wave 10 repeats wave 8 or 100% of it.
Wave 11 completes only 75% of wave 10 and indicates less selling pressure.
Each swing turn will be very close to a percentage of a previous range and a support
and resistance level of a past range. Where there is a group or cluster of levels, then
that is a more important area to watch.

Once the swing chart has been constructed, buy and sell signals generated by what Gann
termed the “mechanical method” trading system appear quite clearly as do the locations 
for stop loss placements.

Following is a 1 day bar chart and the corresponding swing chart of the French CAC 40
8th April 2005 high at 4144. The final range of 112 is 125% of 90.5 and 87.5% of 158
was at 4148. Note the repeating 72 and 73 point price ranges. The absolute price of
4,144 and the final price range of 112 are important numerically when used in
conjunction with the time cycle that was present at this high.

If the trend is up, which is signaled by consecutive higher lows, a buy signal is
generated when a new high is made following a swing bottom. A sell signal is generated
during a down trend when a new low is made immediately after a swing top. New sell
signals are generated every time after a reversal a new low occurs. The sell signal is
generated as the new low is made.
As markets often repeat their trading ranges, and if a market has retraced 50% of its last
range, then by the time the buy signal has been made 50% of the move has completed.
If it has been a false break, and a reversal is occurring, then the stop loss position can be
a long way off. The way to enter the trade earlier when swing trading is by using price
reaction to support and resistance levels. This is done by waiting until the day after the
day that the retracement ended. This is, when on the next day if the market trades back
in the direction of the main trend by the swing chart turning back up, this is the entry
signal. A stop can be placed behind the retracement high or low point.
In the following chart of an Australian bank CBA, the 4th May 2000 clearly indicated a
resumption of the main trend. The retracement had completed at the 33.3% level of the
main range (solid line) and at 66.6% of the most recent range (dashed line). The
following day turned the swing chart up shortly after the days open providing the entry
signal. The 4th May showed increased volume to the preceding few days.

Like any trend trading system the possibility exists for being whipsawed, but this can be
reduced by applying a filter such as the 2 day swing chart or weekly swing chart. A 2
day swing chart only has its trend line move when there is 2 successive higher days or 2
successive lower days occurring when moving away from a low or high point. It then
continues for each successive day in that direction ignoring 1 day counter trend moves.
The line then reverses only when there is 2 successive days in the opposite direction.
This type of chart is shown earlier in this section. The weekly swing chart is constructed
using the same rules as with the one day swing chart.
The trend line indicator only changes direction when we have an opposite day to the
trend. That is on a down day in an uptrend, or, on an up day during a down trend. This
doesn't mean the market has made a top or bottom. A top is not confirmed until a lower
top is formed, and a low is not confirmed until there is higher bottom.
Swing charts clearly identify trends in the market removing a lot of noise that might
normally be hidden when only using bar charts. A trend is defined by progressive
swings in the same direction.

for monitoring amarkets’trend. This enables different perspectives of the market.
Where analysis of the different swing charts results in similar price projections it can be
a very important level.
As with most things in technical analysis some subjective approaches can be useful. On
occasions you will find that the rules for a particular swing chart may need varying,
Gann’stermforthiswas“theexceptiontotherule”.Youmayfindwhenconstructinga
2 day swing chart that a particular day has a daily range against the main trend greater
than the average, it may be greater than some ranges that are 2 or 3 days in duration, so
you will include this retracement. What you are trying to achieve is a picture of the
market that will show what you need, so the rules can be varied at times.
Swing charts, in addition to monitoring trends, also provide valuable information on
what a market could do next. By noting data, such as the price ranges and the time taken
to complete the ranges, you are able to form a view of what can next be expected.
If applying this system to intraday trading then 1 to 30 minute bars can be used to define
an intraday trend. Stops can be placed below higher bottoms in an uptrend and above
lower highs in downtrends. Smaller time frames are more suitable for active markets.
Using good money management rules and profit / loss ratios, swing trading can define
clear entries points, placement of stops and target price levels at which to take profits or
place stops at in expanding markets. Experienced Gann traders will have learnt to use
the swing chart as the basis of their trading system.

The following chartoftheLondonFTSEshowsGann’s“rule of three”in sections or
waves, the percentage retracements, projections and a strong support level at the next
level after the 50% level at 56.25% at the wave 3 low.
Also count the number of days from the low, the first range took 3 days, the second was
3 days, the third was 1 day, the fourth was 2 days and the last was 2 days. The last three
ranges indicated a weakening market as it had changed its balance from the first two
equal times of 3 days each, and the expanding price range from 79.5 to 110. The top at
the 91 point range (always note ranges that are 90 or multiples of it), was then followed
by a lower top which confirmed the trend had now turned down.
The declines, though sharper than the rallies were not greater in time which indicated
this was not particularly bearish.

RulesforGann’smechanicaltradingmethod appliedto“long”positions.
These rules apply to the daily bar chart and corresponding daily swing chart following.
1.
Trade only with the trend. Higher swing tops and higher swing bottoms ARE
an UPTREND.
2.
The uptrend is defined by point B being above the previous swing high. The
strongest trades are when the minor (daily) trend is in the direction of the
main (weekly) trend.
3.
“Buy”when a reaction occurs back in the direction from A to B from point
C. The point C day will ideally have high volume and close at the high end
of the days trading range. If C is at a Gann level of support of 50% or less
this will indicate strength. These percentage levels are detailed in the
“SupportandResistance”section.
4.
Only buy if you can make a trade entry before 33.3% of the A to B range has
completed. The further the entry from point C will also be the closer to the
end of the move.
5.
The“Buy”entry signal is made when the day after the point C day has
traded higher than the high of the C day. This day should ideally have high
volume that indicates renewed buying.
6.
At the time of entry place a Stop below point C. If the market traded below
C it would mean that the trend has reversed as the swing chart now points
down. The distance between entry and stop at C is the risk cost of the trade.
7.
Calculate from point C the resistance levels the market will encounter as it
moves up according to the Gann levels of 1/8ths and 1/3rds of the price
range of A to B. The 50% level of the previous range is where most
unsuccessful trades fail as it is the strongest resistance level.
8.
Profits can be taken at 66.6% to 100% of the A to B range. If the market is
strong and moving fast place an exit stop below the low of each successive
day so as to protect profits when the market reverses.
Note that the application of timing analysis described in the later sections will give
advance warning of dates that are likely to be reversal points. These time cycle dates
will also indicate dates where resistance will be encountered and when the time of
the end of the markets current run can be expected.
Price cycle analysis will indicate the price levels where resistance can be expected.
Where there is a Gann percentage level and this is also the same place where a price
cycle aligns than it is a stronger area of resistance. Example: in the following swing
chart the 133.3% level at the .50c price range is also the addition of the .37c
and .14c ranges.
For larger time frames for a bigger picture perspective weekly bars can be used in
the same manner as described above.Dailybarscanthenbeused“intraweek”as
hourly bars can be used intraday.

Rules for Gann’s mechanical trading system applied to “short” positions.
These rules apply to the daily bar chart and corresponding daily swing chart following.
1.
Trade only with the trend. Lower swing tops and lower swing bottoms
indicate a DOWNTREND.
2.
The downtrend is defined by point B being below the previous swing low
and point C being below A. The strongest trades are when the minor (daily)
trend is in the direction of the main (weekly) trend.
3.
“Sell” when a reaction occurs back in the direction from A to B from point C.
The point C day will ideally have high volume and close at the lower end of
the days trading range. If point C was unable to reach the Gann level of
resistance at 50% then this will indicate a weak market or strength in the
direction of the down trend.
4.
Only “Sell” if you can make a trade entry before 33.3% of the A to B range 
has completed. The further the entry from point C will also be the closer to
the end of the move.
5.
The “Sell” entry signal is made when the day after the point C day has traded 
lower than the low of the point C day. This day will ideally have high
volume that indicates renewed selling.
6.
At the time of entry place a Stop above point C. If the market traded above
point C it would mean that the trend has reversed as the swing chart now
points up. The distance between entry and stop at C is the risk cost of the
trade.
7.
Calculate from point C the support levels the market will encounter as it
moves down according to the Gann levels of 1/8ths and 1/3rds of the price
range of A to B. The 50% level of the previous range is where most trades
fail as it is the strongest support and resistance level.
8.
Profits can be taken at 66.6% to 100% of the A to B range. If the market is
strong and moving fast place an exit stop below the low of each successive
day so as to protect profits when the market reverses.

4. Support and Resistance Levels
Every stock makes a top or bottom on some exact mathematical point in proportion to
some previous high or low level.
“The movement of any “market” between extreme high and extreme low, either in a 
major or a minor move, is very important and by a proper division of this range of
fluctuation, we determine the points where resistance or support will be met on a
reverse move, either up or down”.WD Gann.
Support and resistance price levels represent psychological areas where stronger buying
and selling can occur. These levels indicate support and resistance areas in a markets
movement. The main Fibonacci levels are at 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%, Gann
levels are the 1/8th and 1/3rd levels or 12.5%, 25%, 33.3% 37.5%, 50% 62.5%, 66.6%,
75% and 87.5% of a range.
The 50% level of price and time ranges was of great importance to Gann and is the first
division applied. It is stronger than the 1/8th and 1/3rd levels. The next important level is
the 66.6% level. There are variations in different markets. Some markets often retrace to
the 50% level. Others might frequently retrace 37.5% or 66.6%. These price levels are
drawn on the working chart.
With larger ranges, such as from a historical low to an all time high, the range can be
divided into 1/16ths.
The concept of dividing a whole into half of a half and one third parts and half of the
third is how Gann instructed ranges in time and price be divided. With the square of 144
or 20,736, to make use of this in markets trading at low prices it can be divided by 256
to obtain the number 81.
Gann’s explanation for dividing a circle or a whole was:
Why are the angles of 1/8 of a circle most important for time and space measurement?
Because we divide $1 into 1/4, 1/2, and 1/8 parts. We use 25c or 1/4, 50c or 1/2 dollar
and long years ago we had 12 ½ pieces. Figuring $100 as a basis for stock prices and
changing these prices to degrees, 12.5 will 45°, 25 will equal 90°, 37.5 will equal 135°,
50 will equal 180°, 62.5 will equal 225°, 75 will equal 270°, 87.5 will equal 315° and
100 will equal 360°.
As a general rule, when unsure as to which range to divide first, simply use the most
recent high and low prior to where the market is currently trading at. Next divide the
range from high to low previous to that. Dividing historical ranges from the all time low
to the major high should always be monitored. This can be done with a spreadsheet and
kept as a record to refer to, or by drawing these levels on the working chart.

Often a market will stop short of reaching a Fibbonacci or Gann percentage level. This
is because as price progresses it needs to complete a cycle, a proportionate part of a
cycle or reach a level that is symbolic of a cycle. A market will often find support at the
50% or other Gann or Fibbonacci percentage level as the range being related to will
have been a cycle or part of a cycle itself.
Dividing a range into 1/16ths can be useful as in the S&P 500 in the following chart.
This can be seen when the market traded up to the 56.25% or 9/16ths level of the 2000
to 2002 range of 807 points on the 3rd January 2005.
Historical ranges are very important as can be seen in the following chart of
Soybeans (CBOT) from July 1999 low to December 2004 highs.

```

### Page 37

```
Page.36
Most charting applications will have a facility to adjust these levels, or they can be
drawn on a chart at the calculated levels.
You will have noticed that some Gann levels are very close to the Fibonacci levels.
They are so close it usually does not matter which you use.
The below chart of the S&P 500 shows three different ranges divided. Where there is
more than one support or resistance level close to each other then there will be greater
support or resistance around this area. The 50% level - the dashed line, is at a similar
level to the 25% main range level, the market on the first day closed near this level, was
supported the next day by it, and opened on two successive days near this level before
finally falling away. The main 50% level being close to the 100% minor level held the
market for 4 days before it finally was able to break through.
Past support levels can become new resistance levels and past resistance levels can
become new support levels.

5. Sections of the Market
Gann’s version of market advances and declines is similar to Elliot’s wave structure. 
Gann said always use the rule of “three” and the fourth section was important to watch 
for a change in trend. Elliot believed that there were three impulse waves with the
possibility of a fifth wave which would be Gann’s fourth section. In any market advance, 
either upward or in decline, watch for these sections or waves to complete.
In a typical campaign either in a Bull or Bear market there will run 3 or 4 sections. This
statement can be confusing unless you know whether to use a 1 month, 1 week or 1 day
chart. There is some subjectivity needed with many of Gann’s statements. Sometimes 
these charts will show clearly these sections but on occasions an “x” points swing chart 
will be useful to determine the sections.
In both a bull and bear market if there are two sections or waves, then there usually will
be more. This does not mean that the third will be successful. It means that three or
more sections will be attempted. This is what swing charts in their various formats will
tell you. If during an advance the swing ranges or waves are becoming weaker or
decreasing in time and price duration it means the market is changing its balance and
weakening. If during a bear market the swing ranges or waves down are decreasing in
time and price duration, then there is less selling, or more buying support, which can
indicate an end to the downward move is near.
Elliott wave theory is a popular market wave analysis method and it sometimes works
very well, usually in hindsight. A problem with it is that you can fall into the habit of
needing to label every wave and then have too rigid an expectation of the markets.
Gann’s market sections interpretation does not require such a fixed perspective. As a 
trader, when trading the swings as they present themselves according to the minor –1
day, and larger time frame – 2 day or weekly swing chart method you don’t need to 
know much more than where you are in the market, where your profit target is and stop
loss order is located.

Page.38
Typical campaign section or wave structure
Firstly there is a rally from the bottom, than the market will fall back into the range of
the rally and settle on support levels.
The next rally starts and prices move into higher territory above the high of the first
advance and then it falls back to support levels.
A third rally commences and prices move to higher levels again above the high of the
second advance. This often is the end of the advances and can spell the end of the
advances altogether.
The fourth rally or attempt, is the most important to watch. In a strong market it will
succeed and in a weakening market it will fail and will form the first lower top which
can indicate the beginning of new trend in the opposite direction.

Markets form a series of waves or sections that can be useful when anticipating an end
to a run of successive highs or lows as can be seen in the following charts, note that in
the first chart, in the first set of 3 waves, Wave 1 was 6 days down, wave 2 was 6 days
down and wave 3 was only 3 days down, or a 50% retracement in time. The arrow
shows the first higher low, coming off the main low.

The following are WD Gann’s statements on interpreting a markets behaviour by
observation of its appearance.
Buying power greater than selling power: When a market advances, it advances on
buying and increased demand. Selling power greater than buying power: When the
supply exceeds the demand, and selling power is greater than buying power, it is
natural that prices must decline to a level where support or buying power will come in
and overbalance selling power.
Reactions are smaller at higher levels: In a Bull market reactions get smaller as
prices go higher, because optimism and hope increase after a prolonged advance.
Reactions are small because there are buying orders under the market as people are
waiting for reactions to buy. Therefore, do not expect large reactions at high levels until
final top has been reached. When the first reaction exceeds the last reaction in a Bull
market, you can figure that the trend has reversed temporarily.
Single top: Is where a market does not reach the same level a second time days, weeks
or months apart.
Single bottom: Is where a market declines to a low level making a bottom that does not
reach this same level again, days, weeks or months later.
It is these tops and bottoms that mark waves or main sections that are of more
importance when applying Gann angles, calculating time periods and the main
trend’s support and resistance levels.
 
 .
 
6. Market Patterns
```

### Page 42

```
Page.41
Often reactions to double bottoms and tops are greater than the more general rule of a
range repeating a similar amount. Markets will often react 150% to 200% off a double
or triple top or bottom if the reaction is in the direction of the main trend.
 
 .
 
Double tops and bottoms: A double top is when a price advances to a high level, then
reacts and advances again to the same level a second time. These double tops are
important if they occur weeks, months or years apart. The more time between the top
and bottom, the more important it is.
```

### Page 43

Page.42
Old tops and bottoms become resistance and support in the future. This will be found at
the horizontal axis and the diagonal with trend lines and Gann angles.
The following chart has been added 6 months after the above chart.
 
 .
```

### Page 44

```
Page.43
  
  
 
 
     
Triple tops and bottoms: Are the most important. By going over past records, you will
find that the greatest advances and declines, or those that last the longest start from
triple tops and bottoms.
Double tops and bottoms can occur in any time frame, from 1 minute to many years
apart. A double top or bottom that occurs in the direction of the main trend will usually
result in a greater reaction to the range that formed from the top to the lowest point in
the V or the bottom the highest point of the reversed V. They are valid even though the
tops or bottoms may not be exactly at the same level. The swing chart is the clearest
way to observe these patterns.
Higher bottoms and higher tops: Supply and demand govern market movements and it
requires a greater buying power than a selling power to force commodities to higher
levels. After commodities make bottom and start to advance, if they continue to make
higher bottoms and higher tops, the trend is up. They must make higher bottoms and
higher tops in order to show a strong Bull market. Therefore, it is very important to
watch the first, second, third and fourth higher bottoms, and remember to always use
the rule of three in everything. The third higher bottom is just as important as three
bottoms at the same level, because it shows that the market is gaining strength.

Crossing old tops or breaking old bottoms: When a market crosses old tops it is an
indication of stronger buying power and change of trend. When a market breaks old
bottoms it indicates the trend has turned down.
 
 .
 
Lower tops and lower bottoms: After a market makes the final top and selling
pressure is greater than the buying pressure it must naturally decline and make lower
bottoms and lower tops.
The higher bottoms and higher tops at the left in the below chart clearly show the trend
is up. The lower highs and lower lows to the right in the below chart clearly show the
trend is down. These are the safest patterns to trade. By trading in the direction of the
trend, calculating the price support and resistance levels at these higher bottoms and
lower tops and determining the cycle that is present on these dates, it is not difficult to
trade the ranges and exiting at a predetermined percentage level.
```

### Page 46

```
Page.45
Secondary decline or higher bottoms: After a Bear campaign ends, making final
bottom, there is usually a quick rally. Then, the secondary reaction takes place, making
a higher bottom and this bottom is the safest place to buy. Never guess. If you guess,
you are likely to miss the bottoms and tops by many points. If you wait for definite
indication and follow rules you will get in near top and bottom.
 
 .
 
Secondary rally or lower top: After a prolonged advance and the market reaches final
high, there is usually a sharp severe decline. After that there is a secondary rally,
sometimes getting up near the old top and sometimes not reaching it by many points.
You will find that a market seldom fails to have this secondary rally. When the
secondary rally comes, especially after the trend has turned down, it is the safest rally
on which to sell short.

An advancing market will encounter resistance levels at certain percentages of its last
advance. This means that the Gann levels of 12.5%, 25%, 33.3%, 37.5%, 50%, 62.5%,
66.6%, 75%, 87.5%, 100%, 112.5%, 125%, 133.3%, 137.5%, 150%, 162.5%, 166.6%,
175%, 187.5%, 200% etc; are used to determine future resistance levels. This can be
applied to any time frame, from intraday charts to yearly charts.

87.5%, 100%, 125% etc, of the previous range in the same direction will be areas to watch
for a decline to stop at and a retracement to begin from. When a market reaches one of
these percentages and this is also at a support or resistance level of a previous range, then
it is a more important level to be aware of. This can be applied to any time frame, whether
intraday charts or yearly charts.

Time counts commencing from the day of a past important high or low will show the
calendar days, solar degrees and when numbers are divided by seven, the number of
weeks. From a practical point of view this is the most difficult technique to apply to a
chart unless using hand drawn charts. What time counts do is keep you up to date with
the time periods and cycles that are vibrating from previous the high and low points.
There is no other way of knowing today, how many days or degrees there would be
since the October 2002 lows (US markets) or from every weekly turning point since
then, let alone since the 2000 highs without maintaining an ongoing record. Time counts
do this effectively and are extremely important.
The concept is that on the calendar day bar chart, by counting the days from a past high
or low point, when you arrive at certain numbers in calendar days and solar degrees (the
same number days and degrees will often be on different dates) that are to be monitored
as trend change dates, you then watch the price action on that day. If the market action
confirms that the cycle pressure date is working then a trade can be initiated if
supported by other analysis.
From the high or low point on the chart, just above the high, or below the low, you
would start the count at “0”. In increments of 4, 8 or 12, write in each number as 
follows, 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, 168, 180 etc until you
reach 1360 days. These numbers will also give you the approximate position of the date
on which to mark the solar degree times. To calculate the exact date you will need an
ephemeris which will give the degrees for each day of the month. Any number can be
used for the time count line such as 4, 12, 16, 24 or 30. The reason for using increments
of 12 is that there are many important numbers that are multiples of 12.
Every swing turn in a market is a reaction to a previous high or low. Each new high or
low will cause a new reaction. It is simplistic to assume that by only monitoring major
high and lows you will get only major highs and lows again. Any swing turn that
registers on a weekly chart can be used to commence a new time count from. There will
be occasions where from a past major turn you will not find reactions that are as useful
as some reactions obtained from what may appear to be an insignificant swing turn.
This is because there are many cycles vibrating within a market and by commencing a
time count from all weekly swing turns you will pick up most of them by the time the
chart has expanded to a reasonable size.
At each new turn on the chart note the numbers that are present on the time lines. You
will in time recognise certain numbers and how they are related to the important
numbers detailed in the ‘Time Cycles” section.

An important use of time counts is to monitor minor time ranges. The following chart
shows clearly this concept in the Australian Share Price Index with repeating time
ranges calculated by the time count lines.
 
 .
 
When you have more than one time count date vibrating from a past high or low, and
you find another date coinciding with this from a different reference point, such as at 90
degrees (88-92 days) and also a 120 degrees date, on a 168th or 49th day, or any other
combination of the above numbers, whether degrees or calendar days, it means that
there is different cycles that could cause a reaction on that day. The accompanying
charts show how these counts are applied.

When a time count line arrives at a high or low point, underline this number. You will
soon come to recognise certain numbers and their divisions and multiples that
frequently appear at market turns.
These time ranges can also be applied intraday. By counting the one hour bars from past
highs and lows, you will find these repeating time ranges. 12 and its multiples are
common, as are 7 and 15.

Usingtimerangeswithtimecyclesandpricelevelsenablesyoutoforma“picture”of
what may eventuate. You may have noticed in the above chart that the first 73 day time
range appears to start on a Friday which is not the low point on this chart. In the section
on“Markets”,thereismentionofexchangesanddatavendorsaddingtheovernight
trading sessions onto the following day. In this case, the low point came in on the
Friday night but appears as a low for the Monday. If this date was used to commence a
time count from no reactions would be found and you would be unaware of the
reactions from the correct date. When the market you trade has irregular trading hours
you will need to have access to intraday data to be sure of when the high or low was
made. This is important at the weekly turning points only.
The below daily chart of the US dollar shows repeating time ranges. These are not
natural time cycles, but are a time range that becomes habit forming, they can fade and
reappear and new time frames can appear. Time counts will keep you up to date with
these.
```

### Page 54

```
Page.53
Time counts when applied to the weekly chart will show the important cycle numbers
that are detailed in the “cycles” section, without the need for the daily chart. For
example in the 52nd / 53rd week is the 360th degree, in the 90th week you will calculate
the 631st day from the reference date where the time count commenced.
By monitoring time ranges you will see that when a market has repeated the same
amount of time or a percentage of the last time range, points of resistance are met.
If a market repeated a previous time range, and the previous price range was also
repeated, two points of resistance are met simultaneously. If this occurred at an
important cycle date, at a support or resistance level and a Gann angle was at this level
on this day, then it is likely a reversal will occur.
When applying these time counts to a swing chart note the calendar days as well as the
trading days. Sometimes a calendar day range will repeat but in the form of trading days.
A time range can subsequently appear as a price range or a price range can appear as a
time range as well. It is when major time ranges coincide with lesser degree time ranges
that important reversals occur.
In the following chart there are repeating time and price ranges, also 515 is 75% of the
Mars cycle and 229 is 33.3% of this cycle. What is shown is what can occur when
cycles or their percentages meet. Having the chart up to date enables you to be aware of
these events prior to them occurring.
 
 .
 
The reason for this habit forming behaviour of repeating time frames is that markets
have memories. Evidence of this phenomenon can be seen once again in the Australian
Share Price Index futures market chart below.
From its all time low of 458 in 1983, there was a bull market that peaked in 1987. The
final high point was at 2,387 making a total range of 1929 points! The 1929 crash high
on the DJIA was 386.5; The DJIA on the 7th March 2005 made a high at 10,987 (1987)
before reversing. Zeros and decimal divisions can be ignored. This indicates the
relevance of symbolism.

The following chart shows the result of applying time counts to past highs and lows.
When there is an alignment of certain numbers from separate reference points in the
past it will indicate a date that has a cycle or a cycle division coinciding with other
cycles. These cycle “cluster” dates are of more importance.The numbers highlighted
are detailed in the sections on “cycles”
Time counts are best made in increments of 4, 8 or 12. With too large increments it is
easy to miss an important number.

The term “squaring”time and price means to balance time with price. In order to square
time with price proper division of a charts horizontal and vertical axis needs to be done.
Most charting software programs include Gann angles in their indicators list but it is
important to know how to apply them correctly.
After the vertical time resistance line and the horizontal price support and resistance
lines the next important line is the 1 x 1 angle or the line drawn from important highs
and lows that moves up or down at the rate of 1 point per day, week or month which
divides the space and time periods into two equal parts at the angle of 45 degrees.
The second important of these angles is the 2 x 1 angle or the line that moves up or
down at the rate of 2 points per day, week or month and divides the space between the
vertical axis and the 1 x 1 angle into two equal parts at 63.75 degrees.
The third important angle is the 4 x 1 angle or the line that moves up or down at the rate
of 4 points per day, week or month.
The fourth important angle is the 8 x 1 angle that moves up or down at the rate of 8
points per day, week or month.
There are 360 degrees in a circle and angles can be drawn at any one of these degrees.
All the important angles form between 0 and 90 degrees because 90 is straight up and
down and the most acute angle at which a market can rise
To draw a forward and upward direction Gann angle, from a low point, go out 100 days
and up 100 points, you mark this point on the chart and then draw a line between the
starting point and this mark, if the market trades at this line, either up to it, or down to it,
it can be treated the same way as a support or resistance level. To draw a downward
direction Gann angle, from a high point, count out 100 days and down 100 points, mark
this point on the chart and then draw a line between the starting point and this mark.
To apply this technique on a daily bar chart, it will work with both a calendar and
trading day chart, the chart must be correctly scaled, that is, for a 1 x 1 angle to divide a
chart at 45 degrees a 1 x 1 ratio chart must be used, or for every 1 day, the price scale
will need to be 1 point. It can become more complex when a market is at around 10,000
points so what you need to do is alter the scaling to something like 1 day x 8 points, the
1 x 1 angle would then be drawn at the ratio of 100 days and 800 points to maintain the
45 degree angle.

10. Squaring Time with Price / Gann angles

The below chart has been added two months later. It shows the reaction at this angle.
 
 .
 
Following is a daily chart of the Swiss Franc to February 2005. Using the 360 degree
circle and angles being applied at any one of these degrees, the chart shows angles at 1
point increments. A market will often work its way through the space between the
various angles. If this market falls to the same angle that supported the market in
September it would be in the same position in the circle even though it would be
numerically higher in value.
```

### Page 58

```
Page.57
For practical use on a daily chart, initially only apply the 1 x 1 angle that divides the
chart by 45 degrees. Other angles are then applied that match the markets trend as it
moves away from a high or low. This avoids the chart becoming cluttered. The main
angles of 1 x 1 , the 2 x 1 and 3 x 1 etc, can be applied as a guide to rate a new trend
once a new important low or high has been formed. Other angles can be applied as the
need arises otherwise the chart will have unnecessary lines.
With a weekly chart the angles are drawn at 1pt x 1wk, 2 pts x 1 wk, 3 pts x 1 week, etc.
 
 .
 
Below is a weekly chart of the British Pound showing a 1 point x 1 week angle and the
16 points x 1 week angle intersecting with the important high.
```

### Page 59

```
Page.58
From an important high or low by calculating out 100 days and then 100 points up or
down you will determine the first point of intersection, next calculate 200 days out and
then 200 points for the second point of intersection, then 300 days out and 300 points.
This method should be used when extending the angle as the chart grows, rather than
simply drawing the extension from the end of the line already drawn. Any number of
increments can be used depending on the chart size.
To ensure that Gann angles are drawn accurately the table at the end of this section can
be used as a guide to calculate the points of intersection. Add to the reference point
when the market is trending up and deduct from the reference point in a downward
trending market.
“As stocks advance and make higher bottom on the monthly, weekly or daily chart, you 
should always draw angles from higher bottoms. Then when you reach the last section
of a bull market and these important angles are broken from the last bottom you know
that the trend has turned down. Apply this same rule as a market declines. Draw your
angles from each lower top and watch your angles until the stock again crosses the 45°
angle from a second, third, or fourth lower top. The second lower top, or the second
higher bottom is always very important to draw angles from, and to measure time from”.
 
 .
 
Below is a daily chart of the S&P 500 daily chart showing various Gann angles. Note
how the market was not able to reach the 16 x 1 angle again before it fell away on the
3rd January 2005. Initially it had traded above this angle from the August low. The 9 x 1
angle from the intermediate high was the line of resistance until the final January high.

A variation of how time and price can align at reversal points is when time has traveled
a certain distance from a particular point and price has traveled the same distance, but
from a different point. Normally when time and price have traveled the same distance,
from the same reference point, time and price have squared at the ratio of 1 x 1. As
these squarings can be applied in other ratios such as 2 points x 1 day, 4 points x 1 day
or others, so can these other squarings. For example, if at 168 days, from a past weekly
reference point, price from a different past weekly reference point, had traveled 84
points, there would be a meeting of these parts of the cycles.
This can also occur, when from a past weekly reference point, when a time of 168 days
aligns with a price range of 52 points, or any of the many other variations of the cycles
parts and multiples in time and price.
What is occurring, is that cycles are aligning, which in their various forms is what
causes markets to react at certain points in time and price. These alignments occur daily
with intraday charts, daily, weekly and monthly in many forms. In conjunction with the
many cycles that are vibrating from past highs and lows, markets are subjected to many
points of support and resistance causing the volatility seen in markets.
The only way to be aware of these events is by monitoring the time ranges on the
various time count lines from past weekly turns and the price ranges between the
various highs and lows on the swing chart or the bar chart.
A recent example of time and price aligning from different reference points can be seen
in the following weekly and daily charts of the French CAC 40 index. Time in solar
degrees had traveled 50% of the price value.
```

### Page 61

Page.60
By monitoring the time count lines you can be aware of these alignments and the
balancing of cycles and their parts before the market trades into the dates.
The chart below of the Australian SPI shows the various alignments at an
important low in May 2004.

A useful variation of Gann angles is to apply the weekly angle to the daily chart.
There are seven days in the week and by setting the horizontal axis count at 7 rather
than 1 and moving the vertical axis setting to follow the markets position that it is
trading near you will observe the daily support or resistance levels that are calculated by
the weekly angle.
Following is a daily chart that has the weekly angles applied.
Note the horizontal purple price levels. This cycle is detailed in the Time Cycles and the
Price Cycles section.

On a chart scaled at one unit of price to one unit of time, if you were to draw a square
starting with a vertical line up from zero to the high price to be squared, then
horizontally forward the identical units of time, then vertically back down to zero, a
square will be formed. The forward vertical line will measure a square in time, of the
units of the high price.
These squares of price to time are areas to look for a counter trend reaction to price
movement. The Gann percentages are to be monitored also as well as multiples of the
first square.
A high price of 100 would square out time 100 days forward from the date of the high.
On a weekly chart it will be 100 weeks, on a monthly chart it will be 100 months.
The S&P 500 on the 24th March 2000, made a high price of 1574. Using this high price
and dividing it by 1/8ths and 1/3rds and converting these values to days will give the dates
projected forwards of:
25% of 1574 = 393 days = 21st April 01
50% of 1574 =787 days = 20th May 02 high (2 days early)
62.5% of 1574 = 983 days = 2nd December 02 high.
75% of 1180 days = 17th June 03 high.
The above explanation can be related back to cycles. The S&P 500 high price of March
2000 at 1574 is 1260 plus 315. You will find that also at the division of this number
there was at 630 days (50% x 1260) the 14th Dec 01 a weekly low and also at the 945
degree date on the 13th Nov 02 there was also a weekly low. This cycle is detailed in
later sections.

On a chart scaled at one unit of price to one unit of time, if you were to draw a square
starting with a vertical line up from zero to the low price to be squared, then
horizontally forward, the identical units of time, then vertically back down to zero a
square will be formed. The forward vertical line will measure the first square of time of
the low price
A low price of 100 will square out in time 100 days forward from the date of the low.
On a weekly chart it will be 100 weeks and on a monthly chart it will be 100 months.
The S&P 500 low on the 10th October 2000 was at 767.5. Using this low price, and
dividing it by 1/8ths and 1/3rds and converting these values to days will give the dates
projected forward of;
12.5% of 767.5 or 95 days = 13th January 03 high.
62.5% of 767.5 or 480 days = 2nd February 04 high.
66.6% of 767.5 or 512 days = 5th March 04 high.
87.5% of 767.5 or 673 days = 13th August 04 low.
When a market encounters a support or resistance level in the future related to a
previous high or low price it is because that high or low was a numerical value related
to a cycle. The proportionate parts or Gann percentages of a cycle or its parts will then
become points of support or resistance.

12. Squaring a Low price
```

### Page 66

Page.65
When squaring lows and highs in time, we project forward the units of price, converted
to time units. We do the same when squaring a price range in time. First we measure the
units moved from either a low to a high, or a high to a low, and then calculate forward
from the turning point of that range in the increments of 1/8th and 1/3rd of that range.
The S&P500 high on the 24th March 2000, made a range of 1412.45 from 161.55 in
December 1984. Using this price range and dividing it by 1/8ths and 1/3rds gives the
values of 176.5 and 471. Converting these values to days projected forward from the
24th March 2000 will give the dates where reactions occurred at:
37.5% of 1412.45 or 529 days = 4th September 01 lower high.
62.5% of 1412.45 or 882 days = 22nd August 02 high. (1 day over)
100% of 1412.45 or 1412 days = 5th February 04 low. (1 day early)
112.5% of 1412.45 or 1589 days = 2nd August 04 high. (1 day early)
125% of 1412.45 or 1765 days = 23rd January 05 low.
This same technique also applies to a range measured from a high to a low.
From a high to a low or low to a high is a cycle, part of a cycle or multiple of cycles.
Markets progress in time a number of units related to cycles. Markets progress in price
to a value related to cycles. Consequently when a market turns at a point in the future
related to a previous range it is because that range was a cycle or a part of a cycle and
therefore the divisions of that cycle will be points of support or resistance in the future.

From any extreme low level use the low level as a base and use the percentages of this
base to determine resistance points from tops to bottoms on the way up. By using the
percentage of the tops you can determine resistance points or bottoms on the way down.
The accompanying table shows how to calculate these levels. You will find that most
markets base numbers are related to important cycles. 458 in the following SPI chart is
66.6% of 687, the Mars orbit cycle and the S&P 500 1984 low at 161.25 is 1/8th of 1290.

In WD Gann’s Stock market course it is stated;
“Every movement in the market is the result of a natural law and of a cause which 
exists long before the effect takes place and can be determined years in advance… 
Everything moves in cycles as a result of the natural law of action and reaction. By a
study of the past, I have discovered what cycles repeat in the future. In order to be
accurate in forecasting the future you must know the major cycle as the most money is
made when extreme fluctuations occur.
Great Cycle –Master Time Period –60 years.
This is the greatest and most important cycle of all, which repeats every 60 years or at
the end of the third 20 year cycle. You will see this importance of this by referring to the
war period from 1861 to 1869 and the panic following 1869; also 60 years later –1921
to 1929, the greatest bull market in history followed.
50 year Cycle.
The major cycle of stocks occurs every 49 to 50 years. A period of “jubilee” years of 
extreme high or low prices, lasting from 5 - 7 years occur at the end of the 50 year cycle.
30 year cycle.
The 30 year cycle is very important because it is ½ of the 60 year cycle and contains
three 10 year cycles. It is caused by the planet Saturn. This planet makes one revolution
around the Sum every 30 years. Saturn rules the products of the Earth and causes
extreme high or low in prices at the end of each 30 year cycle
20 year Cycle.
One of the most important time cycles is the 20 year cycle, or 240 months and most
stocks and averages work closer to this cycle than any other.
15 year Cycle.
15 years is ¾ of a 20 year cycle and important because it is 180 months or ½ of 360.
10 year Cycle.
The next important cycle is the 10 year cycle. It is important because it is 120 months or
1/3 of 360. Fluctuations of the same nature occur which produce high or low every 10
years.
7 year Cycle.
This cycle is 84 months. You should watch 7 years from any important top or bottom. 42
months is or ½ of this cycle is very important. You will find many culminations around
the 42nd month. 21 months or ¼ this cycle is also important.
The minor cycles are 6 years and 3 years, the smallest cycle is 1 year.

From a practical point of view a trader needs to know when the more common day to
day and weekly reversals will occur. The time periods and cycles that are required to be
monitored to do this are explained in this section. Always remember it is the
combination of time and price factors that is required when determining market
reversals.
The common cycles we are familiar with are those that affect us in our regular activities,
such as the 1 minute or 60 seconds, hourly or 60 minutes, daily or 24 hours, weekly or
168 hours and the yearly 365.25 days or 360 degrees. You will often see these numbers
and their multiples in time and price movements in markets. There are numerous other
cycles that have an effect on us whether we are aware of them or not. In 1 day there is
1440 minutes, or 4 x 360.
 
 .
 
These cycles are to be found in markets, however for a trader their practical use can be
limited as they usually are not able to be accurately forecasted. The cycles that are able
to be accurately calculated are detailed in the following pages.
“Itneverpaystoguess.Alwaysconsiderthemaintimeswingofamarket,thenwatch
your weekly and overnight charts until they show a reversal or time has expired. All
markets move in three to four sections. The third or fourth movement up or down marks
theculmination.”
The above statement means to use time and price together. By using the techniques;
“balancingoftime”,“sectionsofthemarket”,“timecycles”,and“pricecycles”together,
and taking into account the major time cycles, it is possible to accurately determine
major tops and bottoms. If you look at the March 21 high in the Australian S&P 200
detailed in the“Reversal Date Analysis”section, an important time factor present at this
datewasthatitwasat5yearsorthe25% divisionofGann’s20yearcyclefromthe

The 7 year cycle when precisely analysed, is one of the two most important cycles a
trader can make use of. It is exactly 2556 days. It is close to the 360 week cycle or 2520
days. Also 2520 days or 360 weeks when calculated in solar degrees is very close to the
7 year cycle of 2556 days. There is some overlap of these various cycles when
calculated in weeks or months. This is likely why the 7 year cycle is often mentioned
today but not easily able to be precisely calculated. WD Gann was aware of this yet did
not detail this in his courses. He did hint at these numbers in some of his other works.
In the supplemental section at the back of this manual Gann mentions the 7 year cycle in
the sections from his stock market course. There is no breakdown of this cycle as in the
preceding paragraph. It is apparent he informed his students of this information in the
private tuition he provided.
Gann stated; “Inmakingmycalculationsonthestockmarket,oranyfutureevent,Iget
the past history and find out what cycle we are in and then predict the curve for the
future, which is a repetition of past market movements,…remember time is the most
important factor of all factors and not until sufficient time has expired does any big
move up or down start. The time factor will overbalance both space and volume. When
time is up, space movement will start and big volume will begin either up or down”.
For the purpose of this course the past history to reference is the exact day of the turn
within a past weekly reversal. The cycles and their divisions are then calculated from
these dates by use of the time count lines, this will then enable exact dates to be
calculated in the future where reversals can occur.
Therearethecyclesthatareuniqueandrepeataswithtimerangesinthe“timecount”
section. There are the symbolic cycles that have their origins in ancient times. As Gann
oftenquotedfromthebible;“thereisnonewthingunderthesun”and“historyrepeats”.
There are planetary, lunar and solar cycles that also have their influence. The lunar
cycle of 28 days is 672 hours or 3 x 224 (Venus) or 4 x 168 (hours in a week).
It is not important that the original form remains the form in which they can
subsequently reappear. An example of this is in the hours of our week, there are 168
hours in our week and consequently 168 can symbolically appear in any other time
period such as 168 minutes, days, degrees, weeks, months or years. The 168 can appear
as $16.80, $168.00 or 16,800 days, degrees, cents or points. A market will often find
resistance or support around these numbers. In the S&P 500, 1176 or 168 x 7 is often a
level this market stalls at. Itisworthrememberingthisinterpretationofacycle’s
number as they appear in markets frequently. This concept appears to be derived from
thebiblicalterm“Iwillappointadayforayearandayearforaday”.Simply put it
doesn’tmatterhowthenumberislabelled,itisthenumberthatisimportant.
Markets react to time cycles and they also react to price cycles. Before any major trend
reversal occurs, cycles will need to have aligned. So when price ranges, price levels,
time cycles and a time range are in alignment then the market has achieved the balance
needed before a reversal occurs.
On occasions where a cluster of cycles are calculated on two or three consecutive days
or over a weekend and the trend is indeterminate it is often best to wait and let the
market make its intentions clear.

The Master 360 Cycle
All cycles are 360 degrees. The quarter and third parts as in Gann’ssquare and triangle
within the circle are the most important parts of a cycle. These divisions for the square
are 90°, 180°, 270° and 360°, for the triangle at 120°, 240° and 360°. The minor
divisions are the 45° or the 1/8th parts and the 30° or 1/12th parts.
The 1 year or 365.25 day cycle when calculated as 360 solar degrees is a very useful
cycle with which to time a markets future turns. A market will often react to the 30 and
45 degree sections of this cycle from past turning points. As with most elements of
technical analysis some type of filter is useful so as to gain what is most relevant. When
calculating cycles, commencing time counts from only important past high or low
points is what is commonly performed. However, each past weekly turning point will
cause a reaction in the future at one or more of the divisions of the Gann emblem of the
numerous cycles present in markets. These past turns were a reaction to an earlier event
and by calculating from all weekly turns you will pick up most of the cycles.
A cycle can be divided into twelve equal parts of 30°, as in the twelve signs of the
zodiac, and eight equal parts of 45°. For practical usage the quarters or 90° increments,
and thirds or 120° increments are most important.
As with the Gann percentages of eighths and thirds being applied to price ranges, these
percentages can be applied to time ranges or cycles as well.

Dividing of Time
The dividing of cycles is derived from the concept of all cycles being a 360 degree
circle. Using our Earth as an example there are 365.25 days in its yearly cycle around
the Sun. When it is viewed as a 360 degree circle and dividing this into its quarter and
third parts of 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, 120 degrees, 240 degrees and 360
degrees, you obtain the six important parts of this circle or a square and triangle within a
circle. Thenumber“7”isthebasisoftime.Tochangefroma minor cycle such as the 1
year cycle to the next larger cycle you multiply by 7. In the case of 90° x 7 you get 630°,
or with 168 days x 7 you get 1176 days or 168 weeks.
The Earth revolves around the Sun in an elliptical path, this means that the distance
from the sun is not constant. This is why days and degrees are not always the same. One
half of the Earths orbit can be 179 days and the other half can be 186 days.
Gann’sdescriptionofdividingtheyearis…..
Divide the year by 2 to get 6 months or 180° angle which equals 26 weeks.
Divide the year by 4 to get the 3 months period, 90 days or 90° each which is ¼ of a
year or 13 weeks.
Divide the year by 3 to get the 4 months period, the 120° angle which is 1/3rd of a year
or 17 1/3 weeks to get 45 days or the 45° angle. This is also 6½ weeks, which shows
why the 7th week is always so important.
Divide the year by 16 which gives 22 ½ days or approximately 3 weeks.
As with the Gann percentages of eighths and thirds applied to price projections, such as
125% or 150%, once a full 360 degrees has been reached, the count can continue in
increments of 30 degrees to become 360 degrees plus 30 degrees, or 390 degrees, then
420 degrees, 450 degrees, 480 degrees, 510 degrees and 540 degrees etc. When 630
degrees is reached the wheel within the wheel concept has its effect, as 175% of 360
degrees is also one quarter or 90 degrees of 360 weeks.
As with the 90 and 120 degree increments of 360 degrees being most important, then
with 360 plus 90 being 450 degrees, and 360 plus 120 being 480 etc. these are the more
important.
With this cycle, solar degree measurements are stronger than calendar day counts. The
365.25 Earth cycle days cannot be divided by 360 to obtain the value of one degree. An
Ephemeris must be used to find the exact degree in the month. The important divisions
are the 90, 120, 180, 240, 270, 360 degrees sections plus 90 and 120 degree increments.
This concept, when taken to the next level orthe“wheelwithinthewheel”isthe360
week cycle or 2520 days or degrees. This cycle can be divided in the same way as the
one year cycle. The one quarter and one third parts of this cycle are 630° and 840°.
Where you have the quarter and third parts of the 360° cycle and the quarter and third
parts of the 2520° cycle aligning on the same day, it will be an important time to
monitor for a reversal. The 90, 120, 180, 240, 270, 360, 630, 840, 900 and 1260 degree
times from a past reference point are the most useful.

To obtain accuracy with time cycles when applied to markets it is necessary to count the
cycle in calendar days or solar degrees rather than using weeks. Weekly counts can be
used on the weekly chart, but you must calculate from the exact date within the
reference week.
As with all cycles the first two quarters and one third are usually more important as time
tends to dissipate the cycles effectiveness.
The 7 year cycle:
The 7 year cycle is 84 months or 365.14 weeks, very close to the Earths orbit number.
At 2556 days, the one quarter divisions are 639 days, 1278 days, 1917 days and 2556
days. The one third divisions are 852 days and 1704 days. Gann in his courses said to
watch for turns in the 42nd and 43rd month. 1278 days is almost 42 months.
The 360 week cycle:
This is 83 months or 2520 days which is very close to the 7 year cycle of 2556 days. It
can be calculated in solar degree and calendar days. 630 solar degrees is ¼, 1260 solar
degrees is ½, 1890 solar degrees is ¾, 840 solar degrees is 1/3 and 1680 is 2/3rds. This
cycle in days is 631, 1262, 1893, 840, 1680, and 2524 days. 1262 days is a little over 41
months and 1260 degrees is within a few days of 1278 days or 50% of the 7 year cycle.
The 20 year cycle:
This cycle is 240 months in duration, or 2/3rds of 360 months or 30 years. With cycles of
this magnitude the accuracy found with the one year cycle, the 360 week and 7 year
cycle and other cycles detailed here is not as precise. For a trader it is not realistic to
take a position using a 1 week to monthly window in which to expect a market to
reverse. This cycle works out to about 7315 days or 1045 weeks.

period meaning a date of greater significance.

The 1 year when calculated as 360 degrees is a minor cycle, but at times a market can
react very well to the 90, 120, 180, 240, 270 and 360 degree vibrations from a past
weekly high or low.
The 90 and 120 degree sections can be extended out until at least 2520 degrees, which is
then 360 weeks in degrees, 900 and 1200 degrees are the one quarter and one third
divisions of 3600 degrees. This is the concept of the wheel within the wheel.
All these numbers whether as a whole, parts or multiples regularly appear in markets in
time and in price movements. Where there are a number of cycles culminating on the
same day it is a time of greater importance.
The two cycles of most use to a trader are derived from the biblical terms of “atime,
timesandhalfatime”,the ancient Hebrew year of 360 + (360 + 360) + (½ x 360) =
1260. Thisisanimportantsymbolic“time”fromtheBible.
The other is to be found in the biblical term “blessedishethatwaiteth,andcomethto
thethousandthreehundredandfiveandthirtydays”or 1335 days. This is an
equallyimportantsymbolic“time”.
Other biblical numbers that appear in markets in time and price are 390, 430, 490, 666,
888, 1150 and 2300. You will see the combined price ranges from 24 Jan 05 to the 17
June 05 totaling a cycle of 2300 in the DJIA at the supplementary information section
further on.
The frequent appearance of these cycles throughout history is proof that the timing of
events is more than coincidence. Some well known events in recent history that are
examples of the cyclical nature of our existence include the following.
It was reported in the Wall St Journal on the 19th November 1860 that “itwasagloomy
dayonWallSt,paperwasnotnegotiable”3600weeksforwardbringsyoutolate1929.
From Armistice Day at the end of WW1 on the 11th November 1918, to the day of the
Normandy landings on the 6th of June 1944 it was 9,339 days or 1334.5 weeks.
From the 7th December 1941, the day of the Pearl Harbor bombing by the Japanese,
until the Hiroshima bombing on the 6th of August 1945 there were 1338 days or 191
weeks, the anagram of 191 is 9/11.
In more recent times there has been the September 11 incident. The numbers 9/11 being
involved could appear to be a coincidence. When you take into account that the Madrid
train bombings in 2004 caused 191 fatalities and from the London train bombings on 7th
July 2005 less 1336 days results in the date of 9th November 2001 or 9/11/01 it adds an
intruiging perspective on what may actually be responsible for the events in our world.
From the start of our AD calendar, plus 1336 years and half of 1336 years, or 668 years,
a total of 2004 years, results in the 25th December 2004. One day off the exact 2004
years was the second worst earthquake in recent history in Asia. The other was in 1556
in China when 830,000 people died, from 1556 to 2004 is 448 years or two times 224,
the number related to the cycle of Venus.

Also of interest, considering that many numbers that appear in our markets today having
had their origins in biblical Hebrew times, is the fact that from the birth of Christ until
1948, the year in which modern Israel was founded there were 1,948 years or 1,262 +
343 + 343 years. 343 is 7 times 49, the number 49 was often quoted by WD Gann as
being the fatal number.
Often the number 49 and its multiples appear in time and price ranges. In the case of the
S&P 200 in Australia, from the record high at the time, on the 14th February 2002 to the
low on 13th March 2003 it was 392 days or 8 x 49.
Once familiar with these numbers and the variations of them, such as their percentages
and multiples you will see them in the markets in price ranges, time ranges and absolute
numbers such as the historical high on the DJIA on the 14th January 2000 at 11,840
points, what you have here is 11 times 1000 plus 840. 840 is one third or 33.3% of 2520
which is the number of days in 360 weeks. The DJIA on the 10th of October 2002 at the
major low point of 7,180 points is 7 x 1000 plus 180 or 1/2 of 360.
It is academic as to the origin of these numbers, and why they are documented in the
bible. If they can be used in markets to accurately predict dates in the future, then that is
what we will do. When conversion of the important numbers to current day usage is
done, the 1260 stays as 1260 degrees and in days becomes 1262, the half is 630 degrees
and in days 631. The 1335 becomes 1336 days or degrees and the half is 668 days or
degrees.
Usingtheconceptof“atime,timesandhalfatime”orthreeandahalftimesatime
period, good results can be obtained, for example the 360 day Hebrew year becomes
1260.Thereisafurtheradjustmenttothisnumberofa“leap”monthof 30 days, which
thenbecomes1290daysordegrees,asymbolicHebrewyearwiththe“leap”month
added is 390 days or degrees. 1336 days x three and a half will become 4,676 days or
degrees. Another very useful number is 672. This is 3 times 224 and 4 times 168.
In summary the cycles of 1262 days and its solar degree equivalent of 1260 degrees, the
number 1290 is the 1260 with a leap month of 30 days added to give 1290. 1336 days
and its solar degree equivalent of 1336 degrees are the most important numbers to know.
Their parts as calculated by the 1/8th, 1/12th and 1/3rd divisions are also to be monitored.
By applying time counts to the daily bar chart at the weekly highs and lows and by
maintaining them in advance of where the market is currently trading you will be aware
of dates in the future where reversals are likely to occur.
Further analysis of the market for pattern and price factors using price cycles and
support and resistance levels when close to these dates is required to determine if a
trading opportunity will become available.

Cycles in calendar days are easily calculated by setting up a spreadsheet with the cycle
numbers added to the reference dates. By making a list of the day of the monthly highs
and lows and adding the cycles to these dates you will determine the most important
cycle dates. Do the same with the weekly highs and lows. On the dates where there is a
“cluster” or combination of cycle dates then that will be a more important date to 
monitor.
Cycles calculated in solar degrees most often work out to be different to the calendar
day count dates. In each zodiac sign there are 30° or 360° in the year. To calculate 630°
you will find the same degree date as the degrees of the reference date but 21 months
later. To calculate 668° you will find the same degree date 22 months later for 660° and
then add another 8°. An ephemeris is required for this.
In the following monthly charts of the S&P 200 the vertical blue and purple lines clearly
show the ¼ parts of the 3600 week cycle or 6,310 days and the 1/8th parts of the 3,817
week cycle or 20 x 1336. Being a monthly chart the exact dates are sometimes days or
even weeks inaccurate.

The orbital cycle of the earth is why there is seasonal change. These changes often
affect the behaviour of human nature as the climate changes from warm to cold. Due to
weather inconsistency, some years are times of plenty and others are years of shortage.
Consequently, prices will rise and fall over a period of time and will form a cyclical
pattern. An example of this seasonality is the way the cost of Oil rises during cold
weather.
The ninety degree annual astrological dates are strong times for change. Their
significance is greater when other planetary cycles such as full and new moons,
planetary conjunctions or oppositions coincide with these times.
These four times of the year are when the sun crosses the equator, at the March equinox
or zero degree cardinal point of the year, which is the 21st –22nd of March. The next is
when the Sun crosses the equator into the Southern Hemisphere, when night and day
have equal length. This is the 180 degree cardinal point on the 21st –22nd of September.
The June 21 - 22 solstice is when the Sun reaches its highest position in the sky over the
Northern Hemisphere. This is the longest day of the year and at the 90 degree cardinal
point of the year. December 21 - 22 solstice is when the Sun reaches its lowest position
in the sky over the Northern Hemisphere. This is the shortest day of the year and the
270 degree cardinal point in the year. These dates are important to watch as they often
signal a cyclic change in the markets. There are two other times of the year that are also
important. The perigee and apogee, these are the times when the Earth is at its closest
and most distant from the Sun.
The astrological year begins at the March equinox or the zero degree date. This is when
the Sun crosses the equator to the Northern Hemisphere. From this date, as with the
twelve signs of the zodiac, each month is thirty degrees in progression until the full
cycle of 360 degrees is complete. These zero degree dates each month are possible
times for changes in a markets trend, especially if other cyclical time and price analysis
is present.
If these times coincide with other planetary phenomena, or the other important cycles,
they have a stronger significance for change, as with new or full moons and solar
eclipses. The March equinox is often a time of change in various markets.

“SeasonalTime”isnotastandalonetimingindicator,butwhencoincidingwithother
timing techniques it adds support to the analysis.
As an example, the S&P 500 high on Friday the 21st March 2003 was at the 0° time, it
was also at 180° from the 22nd August 2002 high (to Saturday the 22nd March) and it
was also 240° from 24th July 2002 low (again to Saturday the 22nd March). When a
cycle culmination date is forecasted for a weekend or other non trading day, the market
will most often react on the Friday or the trading day before. If the reaction does not
occur on this day then the first trading day after the break needs to be monitored.
The example below, even though exhibiting some factors for a reversal, was not a signal
for a short position unless short term trading as the high was above the previous weekly
highs, indicating the trend was up. It also showed an expanding market from a range of
54.6 to 73.8, which usually means there is more to come in this direction. If a long trade
had been in progress from the outside day reversal on the 17th March, closing this trade
at 100% of the 54.6 range would have locked in profits.

Gann stated that time and price can be treated in the same way.
Time is measured from a past reference point, and by knowing the duration of a time
cycle a future date can be calculated. The same concept can be applied to price. From a
high or low point on a chart, by knowing the cycle numbers that price moves in, the
price ranges will indicate when resistance will be met, enabling price projections to be
made. For example, if price made a range of 168 points and it was at 168 days and 630
degrees from various reference points, at a 50% price support level, you would expect a
reaction. Another example is, if a particular date has been calculated, such as 630
degrees from a past weekly turning point, and within a few days prior to this date a price
range was a little short of 630 points or cents you would watch to see if this important
number aligned in time and price on the same day. If it did, there is a high probability of
a trend change. This would mean that time and price have met a point of balance.
Variations of the above can be found when a time cycle meets a price cycle that has
originated from a different source. For example, if price had declined 168 points from a
high, and a time cycle of 1260 degrees had aligned with the 168 point decline at the
same time, then the moment this occurs you could expect a price reaction.
An example of this is in the “Time Cycles” section, where in the CAC 40 at a time
range of 345 degrees, price from a different reference point had traveled 690 points or
time and price balanced at a ratio of 2 x 1.
To be aware of these events, a good knowledge of cycles and their divisions and their
multiples is required. By noting the price ranges at each weekly range, and the other
intermediate and major ranges, you will become familiar with the numbers. You will
find they are all related to the numbers in the “Time cycles” section in some form or 
other. It is unlikely that you will be counting from 1989 to have calculated the 5,679
days as in the US dollar chart however there was present the 630° time period.

Certain cycles, their parts and multiples appear frequently in markets. As time cycles
often repeat so do price cycles. By dividing the cycles by 1/8th and 1/3rd you will
calculate the various ways in which they can appear as a price.
Some of the more common are 42, 49, 52, 84, 88, 89, 98, 104, 122, 128, 132, 144, 147,
156, 162, 168, 171, 188, 191, 196, 224, 229, 244, 252, 264, 272, 288 & 312. By
recording the price range on the chart below each low and above each high you will
become familiar with these numbers.

Following is an example from the Australian SPI at the 23rd March 2001 low. At the
time of the March equinox, at 360 degrees from the March 2000 high, when 33.3% of
the Mars cycle of 687 had completed there was a trend reversal.

S&P 500
The S&P 500 chart displayed at the Ganncycles.net website is detailed above.
By calculating the 1/8th and 1/12th divisions of the main cycles from major highs and
lows you will determine the important price support and resistance levels that a market
will encounter as it progresses up or down.
This is essentially the same concept as calculating the cycles from past highs and lows.
The difference is that time does not reverse. Calculating these price levels can be done
using a simple spreadsheet. Using the S&P 500 as an example the historical low was at
101.15. By adding the Gann percentages of 12.5% or 1/8ths and the 1/12th divisions to
the low of 101.15 you will determine these levels.
If you are familiar with Tunnel thru the Air you may recall that Gann when calculating
time periods used the method of adding cycles together. In the above S&P chart the low
of 101.15 + 1290 = 1391.15. The March 2000 high was at 1574, 182.85 points more
than 1391.5. 182.85 x 2 = 365.7 or the cycle of one year.

Below in the DJIA the horizontal lines are at levels of each of the full cycles calculated
from the 7180 October 2002 low. They also can be calculated from the March 2000

greater importance. The cycle numbers colour denotes that cycles price level.
A simple way of being aware of these levels on your computer charts is to calculate the

Adding 191 and 147 results in 338 or 50% of 676.
At the 168 range from the May low, resistance at the same level of $9.88 has been
encountered on three occasions. Adding 191 and the range of 168 together results in 359.

A visual representation of cycles.
Shown below are the important cycles of 360, 1260, 1290 and 1336 with the 50%
divisions in time and price.
WD Gann stated that time and price can be treated in the same way. The only difference
in calculating the two is the fact that as time moves away from a reference point a cycle
will at some time complete. It can then work in multiples of its original form also. Price
can move away from a reference point and at a later time can come back towards that
reference point. This will cause a past resistance level to then become a support level.
Only shown are two aspects of the cycles, they can also be divided by the 1/8ths and
1/12ths and also be calculated in calendar days and solar degrees.
Note the cluster of resistance levels at the 50% price levels and the two reversals at the
50% time divisions.
An important high was at the 1260° date at the top right of the diagram.

On a chart scaled at one unit of price to one unit of time, if we were to draw a square
starting with a vertical line up from zero to a high price, then horizontally forward the
identical units of time to the high price, then vertically back down to zero, a square will
be formed. The forward vertical line will measure the first square in time of the units of
the high price.
When time and price have travelled an equal distance on the vertical axis and the
horizontal axis, regardless of the scale used, we have a square. If after 100 days in time,
price had risen 50 points then there would be a half square, or a rectangle - if this were
drawn on the chart. If you imagine a set of building blocks being stacked next to each
other, and on top of each other, than this is how a market progresses, as it moves
forward in time and in price. These blocks are at the size of the 1/8ths and 1/3rds of
certain base numbers. These numbers are detailed in the cycle’s section.
The major range in the S&P 500 up to the 24th March 2000 of 1412 points is 16 times
88. The following bear market range down to the 10th October 2002 of 807 points is
225% x 360. The next range up of 454 to the 3rd January 2005 is very close to 125% x
360 and 512.5% x 88 at 925% of 88 in days. The combined ranges of 807 and 454 equal
1261 or 3.5 times 360. The combined ranges of 1412, 807 and 454 equal 2673 or 2
times 1336.
What is happening is that price, as it progresses unfolds according to certain numbers
and cycles. This is another very important concept that can indicate that a market has
reached a price level where it will reverse. At the date of 3rd January 2005 in addition to
the 1261 and 2673 points this date was at 1262 days from the weekly high on 19th July
2001 and 1260 degrees from the weekly high on the 2nd July 2001.
Market squares become more complex to analyse when a square, or a proportion of that
square, of a particular number has unfolded in either time or price, and a square, or a
proportion of the square of another number has unfolded on the other axis of time or
price.
The time counts on the chart will tell you when the numbers that are important are
present at the horizontal axis, the price ranges from the swing chart and the bar chart
will tell you when they are present at the vertical axis.
As markets progress forward in time they conform to cycles and their divisions. As they
move up or down in price they conform to these cycles as well. When a market
progresses in time and price at certain points you will be able to calculate that there
have been a certain number of cycles along the bottom axis and a certain number of
cycles on the vertical axis. When these align at price support or resistance levels you
can expect a reversal.

The use of this type of analysis is limited as only the perspective of calendar days or
weeks is able to be viewed. The amount of time that alignments of these types appear is
not usually sufficient as to warrant inclusion as a primary form of analysis.
As has been seen most time and price alignments occur when originating from different
reference points. A market may have progressed 168 days in time and 168 points in
price from two entirely different past reference points so it is not particularly useful to
limit analysis to the limited perspective of using a chart overlay.

The following weekly chart of the Australian SPI shows the square of 168 days x 168
points. The dotted vertical and horizontal lines divide each square by 42. The time from
the first high to the low was 84 days or 50% of 168. Note that this markets low actually
occurred on September 21st 2001 during the markets night session. The price range
down to the low shown was 631 points or 375% of 168. The time range up to the next
high on March 8 2002 was 168 days and the price range was 674 points or 400% of 168.
This example shows how clear overlays that Gann developed, of 52, 144, 168 and 360
can be used. The same result can also be achieved by knowing the important numbers,
their divisions and monitoring them on the horizontal axis with the time counts and on
the vertical axis by the price plot.
The weekly SPI chart below from 2000 to 2002 shows this market reacting in time and
price to the square of 168. From the left side high to the Sept 21 low was 84 days or
50% of 168 and 375% of 168 in price. To the 2002 high was 168 days by 400% of 168
in price.
To this high in the below chart from 11th November 1983 at the price of 1054 there was

main high to the low that there was a price range of 108 points, this number is 75% of
144. The solar degree time taken to get to the low was 73 solar degrees or 50% of 144.
The square, or more correctly a rectangle, formed by the addition of the four sides is
362. 362 is midway between 360 and 365, two of the important numbers.
From the next high after the main high the addition of three times 89 plus 95 equalled
362. As this exact repeat of the previous square of 362 occurred on a 668 solar degree
date this market reversed. The next step in actually trading this set up would be by use
of the 1 day swing chart to show a lower top, which the market did at the fifth trading
day later.
Alternatively, a little after this market opened the day after the 668 degree high a short
position could have been taken with a stop above the previous day.

One of Gann’s methods in determining a major high or low was to calculate the time 
from a high to a low, from the high to the next high, from the low to the next high and
from the low to the next low. Markets tend to repeat minor time ranges and minor price
ranges; they also repeat major ranges in time and price.
Below is a weekly chart of the Australian Share Price Index from 8th March 2001 to 23rd
August 2002 showing this markets major reversals at times when the time periods were
balancing on the cycle of 168.
SPI –Aust.
Balancing of time is an important part of market analysis when forecasting major highs
and lows. Markets constantly seek order or balance in the midst of their seemingly
chaotic behaviour. When this balance has been achieved technically, a markets trend
will reverse, the cycles in time and price that every few days align with the support and
resistance levels will then act as obstacles in the path of the market as it works its way
towards the next major point of balance.
You will see in the following chart this same market balancing on the number 370. The
first 370 day time period down to the 13th March 2003 (lowest point) was 366 degrees
or the number related to the Earth cycle. The major high on the 21st March 2005 was at
200% of the 370 day time period.
By using the combination of time ranges and time cycles, you are able to calculate dates
that may be market reversal times. By using the methods from the swing chart, price
levels at which a market may reverse can also be calculated.

Balancing of time is essentially the same concept as that covered in the section on “time
periods”. Instead of monitoring smaller time ranges between weekly turns on the daily
chart, you will be monitoring the repeating time periods, or percentages of them, using
major highs and lows instead. These will be a recognisable number from the high to the
high and from the low to the high as in the above chart of 3 x 370 from the high to the
next high and 2 x 370 from the low to the high.
 
 .
 
By calculation of the interim time ranges, or the day counts from a past weekly turning
point applied to the chart, you will know on which dates these repeating sections will
end. On these days if there is an important time cycle, coinciding with the time ranges,
then there is a likely chance that on this date there will be a reversal.
Below is a more recent example of this market. As markets progress they encounter
points of resistance when the various cycles or their important parts align.
Understanding these cycles and having a chart correctly set out enables you to foresee
these points in time and price where reversals will occur.

The only way to recognise these time periods and be aware in advance that they will be
aligning, is by using charts that show the time counts and time cycles in a way that you
are aware of them in advance. Computer charts are not able to clearly present this
information visually.
The first price range out from major tops and bottoms often will indicate what cycle a
market is going to be following in the new direction. In the previous chart from the
major high in March 2002 the first price range down was 184 points, 200% of this is
368 and the actual time period was 370 days. From the 13th March 2003 low the first
weekly price range out was 341 points and 475% of this is 4299, the ultimate high was
at 4290. From this important high this markets index the S&P 200, completed a range
down of 372 points.

By using the time ranges together with time cycles, you are able to forecast dates that
are likely to be market reversal times. By using the price forecasting methods, price
levels at which a market may reverse can be calculated.
By calculation of the interim time ranges, or the day counts from a past weekly turning
point, you will know on which dates these repeating sections will end. On these days if
there is an important cycle of 630°, 1260°, 668°, 1336°, 1290° or 631, 668, 1262, 1336,
or 1290 calendar days or (at a lesser extent) the 90° and 120° parts of the 360° cycle
coinciding with the interim time range, then there is a strong chance that this date will
be a reversal. The smaller cycles will not alone at major tops and bottoms indicate a
reversal of the trend, an important cycle will also be present if a reversal does occur.
Recurring 68 and 91 day time frames aligning with a 180° cycle is shown in the S&P
500 below. Confirmation of this trend change was on the following Monday –where, as
Gann said “the safest place to buy is after the first higher bottom”, this was at the open 
on the Monday. There was 1290° present at this low also.

The following chart of the Australian SPI shows an example of how to calculate a date
in the future by using already known factors.
Watching for the important time period of 370 days from the 8th March 2002 high to the
13th March 2003 low to repeat, showed that it did from the low on the 18th November
2003 to the low on the 22nd November 2004 and again from the low on the 6th May
2005 to the high on the 12th May 2006.
By calculatingforward370daysfromthe“weekly”chartshighandlowdates, you will
determine certain dates in advance. By then calculating backwards the key cycles from
these forecasted dates you can then determine if the forecasted date will also be a date
on which one of these cycles will end.
Alsocalculatethepriceprojectionsasexplainedinthe“SwingChartsSection”.This
will enable a price and a date to be forecasted. Note in the chart below the 101% repeat
of the 645 point (50% x 1290) price cycle. By calculating percentages of the first range
out from the 13th March 2002 low and marking these levels on the chart will also add to
the forecast In this case the 12th May 2006 high occurred at exactly 8 times of the first
weekly range of 341 points from the 13th March 2003 low.

Using Gann analysis for intraday trading is done by using hourly time cycles, time
ranges, support and resistance levels, price ranges and Gann angles to determine price
levels where a reversal may occur. If you are an aggressive trader you can initiate a
trade very close to these levels with a stop a little beyond the point of the reversal. You
need some confirmation before entering the trade, but of course the more confirmation
you obtain the more you will be giving up of the anticipated move.
It is important to know that such minor cycles are only to be used as a method of
entering a trade close to a calculated turning point on a one day chart, such as at the 630,
631, 668, 1262, 1336 or 1260 day or degree dates, or to exit a position by the same
technique.
Counting time, using one hour bars can indicate the approximate time of a reversal
within the day, using fifteen minute or five minute bars can get you within minutes of
the reversal, although a little longer may be needed for the price action to confirm the
reaction. With experience, using intraday data on cycle dates, you will get to “know” a 
reversal as it happens. Markets exhibit similar behaviour at these points of reversal.
Time counts work as well in the smaller time frames as well as in the larger time frames.
By using intraday time counts at the same parts of the division of 360 and its percentage
increases ie; 30, 45, 60, 90 etc. hours on a 90, 120, 180, 240, 270, 360, 630, 1260 etc.
degree date, very close entries can made at the reversal times. 56 days is 1336 hours is
55.6 days, 1290 hours is 53.75 days and 1260 hours is 52.5 days. These time periods
when aligning with the larger cycle dates will indicate a date of greater importance.
There are the other numbers from the “Time Cycle” section which are important to 
watch. Where there are a group or cluster of these numbers at the price levels detailed in
the swing chart section then that is likely to be a turning point. You will see these
numbers in the following 1 hour charts.
The concept is that when large cycles align with smaller cycles it is a more important
time for a change or a new beginning. For example in the 90th week, the 90th day or
degrees, at the 90th hour and the 90th minute, or any other combination of the important
numbers you will have the wheel within the wheel effect.
Daily counts are made from past important highs and lows, hourly counts can be made
from significant turning points on a one day chart.
If you were trading the following chart you would only trade in the direction of the
trend which means only long positions up to the highs and only short positions from the
highest point. You would do this by drawing a swing chart on a sheet of graph paper or
connect the high and low points on an intraday live chart. This swing system is detailed
in earlier sections.

Gann angles are used on intraday charts as you would in any other time frame, but by
using trading hours. As an example, from a low point 100 hours ago, the angle would
intersect at 100 points above the originating low point.
As with using the weekly swing chart or 2 day swing chart to clearly define the daily
trend, use the 1 day swing chart or 1 hour swing chart to monitor the main trend when
intraday trading. Trades in harmony with the main trends are safer and stronger.
When using price support and resistance levels between a high and low point regardless
of the time frame, calculate between the most recent high and low first, then the next
high and low that occurred before that. When there is a cluster of price support or
resistance levels in the one area it will be a more important level.
In the following 1 hour chart of the Australian S&P 200, you will see the time count
startingat“0”atthelowonthe9th December 2004. 42 hours is ¼ of 168 (hours in a
week), 52, (weeks in a year), 56 (1/4 of the Venus cycle), 72 (½ of 144), 30 (1/12th of
360) 84 (1/2 of 168), 42 (1/4 of 168), 90 (1/4 of 360), 48 (2 x 24hrs) 54 (related to
square of 144), 72 (1/2 of 144), 84 (1/2 of 168), 120 (1/3 of 360) 126 (3/4 of 168) 132
(1/2 of 264), 90 (1/4 of 360) 149 (100 + 49), 108 (3/4 of 144).
Note the time ranges of 42 hours repeating from 0 to 42 to 84 to 126. Also from 0 to 56
to 112.
These numbers have psychological effects that when combined with price levels will
often indicate trend changes.

If using intraday analysis to make trade entries it is important to be aware of the fact
thatmarketsoftenmakea“lastlungeforthetop”.Thismeansthatonareversaldateif
a market has appeared to commence a reversal it can, usually towards the end of the day,
suddenly turn and make a new high a little beyond what appeared to be the reversal high
point. Your analysis may have been correct for the day to be a reversal but if you are
stopped out you can still lose. Using larger time frame intraday bars will delay your
entry but will also provide greater certainty. The reason for this behaviour is that the gap
between the apparent high and the completion of a price cycle will act as a vacuum.
Markets can often close on their high at these times and then reverse from the following
day. Entries can then be made on the day following as the market move away from the
previous days high.

at the 216th hour in the following chart (from the 149th hour in the first chart) at 4140 it
was a signal bar, which indicated that the main trend was resuming. Entry would have
been made on this day by watching for the market to trade above this hours open price,
or by using 2 to 5 minute charts to confirm higher highs and higher lows as described in
the swing trading section.
If you continue the counts from 108 in the previous chart you will come to 120, 126,
135, 144, and 162. The 120th hour was followed by the 121st hour bar having a high
close and indicating the main trend resumption after the first higher low was confirmed.

This section details the factors that were analysed leading into and out of the following
reversal dates including a major high.
This analysis was applied to the Australian Share Price Index futures market from the
9th March 2005, prior to the major high on the 21st March 05, and following this high to
the first lower swing high on the 8th April 05.
The 1 day bar chart, 1 day and 2 day swing charts of this period are shown below. The
50% levels are marked on the swing charts.
The first calculation is made by use of the time count lines to locate the cycle dates. At
the March 9th high, the 1262 day cycle from the 24th September 2001, was present. This
was the major low after 11th September 2001. The half cycle of 631 days from the 17th
June 2003 was also present. When there has already been a reaction to a particular cycle,
as with the 631 day reaction from 24th September 2001 on the 17th June 2003, it
increases the chance that the next parts of that cycle will be effective, in this case the
1262nd day. On this day there were also present a number of minor cycles. All of these
numbers were calculated by the time counts from past weekly turns.

It often does not matter if a past reference point that a time count is commenced from is
not major. All turns occur because an already existing cycle was present. The only way
to keep track of the cycles is by time count lines from each weekly turn. If reactions are
insignificant at the 1260 series, it may mean that the cycle being monitored will prove to
be effective on the 1336 series.
For example, if a time count is commenced from a minor weekly turn when setting up a
chart, you may be picking up a cycle that has its origins much further back. At some
stage in the future an important part of this cycle will reappear at a major reversal date.
Usingthe“BalancingofTime”technique,fromthe2002majorhigh there had elapsed
1097 days and from the 2003 major low there had elapsed 727 days. 1097 days is 3 x
366 and 727 is a little less than 66.6% of 1097, it is also related to 224 and 168. The
time factors were indicative of a possible reversal, however the price range up to this
date of 1576 points did not indicate that price had completed an important cycle.
On the weekend of 11th to 13th March, there were present 1336 degrees and a number of
smaller cycles. Monday the 14th was a larger than average range up day with higher
volume, this indicated that the preceding two down days were a retracement and that the
main trend was still intact.
Monday the 21st March was the equinox at 0 degrees. This market, as do many others,
often turns around this date. It was a date that the secondary cycle of 1260 degrees from
September 24th 2001 was calculated from. There were also present numerous minor
cycles in degrees and days. The price cycle from 13th March 2003 of 1611 points was
analysed using the description Gann gavein“TunnelThrutheAir”ofaddingcyclesto
obtain a result that aligned with the other information. 1611 is 1260 plus 351. 352 is 4 x
88, the first major range out of this market from March 1983 to January 1984 was 351
points.

The Final Top
The first point to consider in taking a position against the main trend is to be aware of
the fundamentals prevailing at the time. As it is common for markets to overshoot on
the upside and on the downside, it is at these times you will find some dissenters. This
serves as a warning of what is on the minds of most, but who are still following the
crowd. The faster and further a market runs then the greater its chances of it becoming
out of balance.Gann’sarticleattheGann Cycles website,“TheGeneralOutlookfor
1929”paragraph 2 is relevant here.
It is the balance of a market that is most important in determining major trend reversals,
the most importantfactortolookatisthe“Balancing of Time”ormonitoringthetime
periods between past major highs and lows.
This isdoneaccordingtotheexplanationinthe“TimeCounts”sectionbymeasuring
time between highs and lows. It is when these time periods work out evenly from major
past reversals that these major tops and bottoms occur. Price cycles, the absolute price
value and percentages of past price ranges also need to be considered.
As with time needing to balance, price does also. The most important price to be
considered in the following chart of the SPI was the exact repeating of the price range
from the 11th November 1987 crash low, up to the 8th March 2002 high which was 2448
points. The 2002 high down to the 2003 low was 837 points, and the 2003 low up to the
March 2005 high was 1611 points, when you add the 837 and 1611 ranges they equal
2448 points.

The low following the main high occurred at 4078 on July 16th at the 2 points x 1 day
angle from the March 2002 high and was 1336 degrees from a high in July 2001. This
chart is on the following page. From this low the market advanced and was to form the
first lower high. It is important to note that this advance was against the new trend
which was now down. It is now a time to watch for lower highs to form.
 
 .
 
The final high pricereachedonMarch21,2005was4290.UsingGann’smethodof

important numbers to monitor.
The Gann angle from the September 2001 low was at 8 points per week or 8 x 1, and
intersected at 4301 on March 21, 2005. At major highs and lows it is useful to also note
the forward contract price levels. The price reached on the forward contract was 4297.
Another aspect to this reversal date was that it occurred on the March equinox. This has
beendetailedinthe“SeasonalTime”section.Thismarkethashadimportantreversalsat
Equinox and Solstice 0 degree dates on many occasions and is always a useful time to
analyse when calculating time periods back to previous major highs and lows.
The next factor to consider is price relative to its previous range. As can be seen in the
following SPI chart on the 21st March 2005 the 4290 high was at exactly 50% of the
previous range in the same direction.Thisisdetailedinthe“Usingarange to calculate a

The next stage of this analysis is determining where the first lower top will form after
this major high was confirmed. The first step is calculating the resistance levels of the
price range down from the high. These are the Gann percentages of 1/8ths and 1/3rds.
Generally this market reaches 1/2 to 2/3rds of the previous range when in a bear market
phase, which knowledge of enabled avoiding the false signals given at the first and fifth
trading days out after the low. Gann’s rule of three showed that there were three 
successive highs before finally falling away from April 8th after reaching a price level of
4185 at 50% of the 4290 to 4078 range.
The next chart shows first lower top formation at 4185. The market was unable to close
above the 50% level on a 1336 degree date and shows the strategic value in placing a
stop above the important 50% level.

From this 4185 high as the market declined it would be expected to conform to the
Gann percentages as detailed in “Usingarangetocalculatealowprice”.The4078to
4185 range was 107 points or 75% of 144. The price retracement ranges of 106 to 111
were frequent in this market leading up to the high. For this range now to occur as an
upward retracement is further evidence of a new main trend.
It is important to know that a cycle that has been calculated from a past reference point
is initially a method of knowing in advance a date that requires further analysis before it
is traded from. The cycles that are of practical use to a trader, or those that are of a
magnitude to be effective and still retain their accuracy, will indicate in advance a
possible reversal date, however to calculate a major high or low, the “balancingoftime”
and other factors need to be taken into account. At times of regular market activity these
cycles in conjunction with minor time periods enable trading opportunities. It is the
markets balance that ultimately determines a major reversal.
The major cycles that Gann detailed in his courses such as the 60, 49, 20, and 10 year
cycles are useful to be aware of, however it is unlikely that a trader would take a
positionbasedonaoneortwoweek“window ofopportunity”without using more
accurate smaller cycles such as those of the 1 year cycle and the 1260, 1290 and 1336
series to initiate a trade.
The times when the larger cycles affect markets is when global markets of similar
categories such as a stock index make high or low at the same time. The most recent
was in March 2003 when global stock indexes made major lows. These dates can be
traced back using historical events. An example of this was on the 19th November 1860,
whentheWallStJournalstatedtherewas“agloomy day on Wall St, paper was not
negotiable”thiswasthedaywhenwarwiththesouthernUSstatesappearedtobe
inevitable. From this date 3600 weeks or 69 years forward gives late 1929. War dates
were of particular importance to Gann. From the 1929 crash low in 1932 plus 69 years
gives 2001, again a year of importance.
The examples used in the above charts of the Australian SPI are no different in concept
toanalysinganyothermarket.TheseareGann’smethodsofanalysis,heappliedthese
methods to marketsmanyyearsagoandtheycanenableananalystoftoday’smarkets

Unless charts are kept that are able to detail the required information needed to

A position trader would have gone long the day after the 630 degree date as a swing

The techniques described in this manual are those that Gann used. There are other
techniques described that without doubt he would have been aware of. These techniques
are meant to be used in conjunction with each other. I have seen important time cycles
not effect a market because the price levels were not met. Many traders depend on price
support levels to reverse the market they are trading and often they do not, because the
time cycles were not present. The time periods or time ranges are equally important. A
time and price squaring from an important high or low serves as a confirmation when
there is the balancing of time with price. A strong cycle needs to be present as does the
market position need to be considered, the price projection or retracement, from
the previous range needs to be completed at the Gann percentages. In addition to these
factors the markets pattern, sections or wave structure needs to be complete before
there is a major trend change. Volume will assist with the analysis of a nearing trend
change.
This is fulfilling Gann’s statement of “when you use time and price together you
know how to trade”.
In summary, a market, on a time pressure date, if the current range has completed a
percentage of its last range, and at a price support or resistance level, and time and
price have balanced, will encounter strong resistance. These factors will then be
followed by a main trend reversal, if the market has completed its sections or wave
counts. If these sections have not completed, then the reversal may only be temporary
as in a retracement. This is why Gann said “the safest place to buyis at the first higher
bottom” and “the safest place to sell is at the first lower top”. This concept confirms that 
a new trend has commenced. Swing charts show this clearly.
Application of these techniques will enable calculations to be made in advance of when
a market changes trend. Coordinating the swing chart with the bar chart tells you when
the price and time factors have aligned.
The safest way to trade is with the trend. Successive higher highs with successive higher
lows indicate an uptrend, lower highs and lower lows is a down trend. When a top or
bottom does occur it will have present the combination of time and price factors, the
trend needs to have completed before this will happen. By applying the information in
this system to these higher bottoms and lower tops you are sure to profit.
Every market turn can be calculated using these methods. There are some that say
Gann’s methods don’t work, what they should be saying is that they can’t get them to 
work. The trade failure rate using these techniques should not be more than 25/30%.
When these failures occur it is because the market was not ready, or had not completed
what it needed to do. This means incorrect interpretation was responsible. Always use
stops. If the markets intentions are unclear, wait for the next set up, you won’t lose by 
not trading.

Reversal Dates
Before a reversal date is traded the following factors must be considered Time, Price
and Pattern. When these three come together, this is when opportunity to profit exists.
The cycle date will identify when the market should react. The price levels calculated at
the Gann percentages of cycles and retracement and support levels on the swing chart
will determine the price levels the reaction will occur at, and the wave section or pattern
will indicate whether the market is at a trend reversal point or only retracing temporarily
before resuming the main trend. The first thing to do is, identify Time.
Time
The time of an expected reversal is identified by the projected cycle and time periods
from a past weekly turning point. A common mistake is the idea that the market must
reverse on every signal date. Often, the market will reverse on the calculated date.
Sometimes the market will encounter resistance before resuming the prevailing trend.
At other times a small correction may result before resumption of the main trend.
This is why pattern –the swing chart, and price –piece cycles, percentage levels of the
last range and relative to the previous range in the same direction must be coordinated
with cycle dates to ensure only trades with the trend are taken.
Pattern
After identifying a reversal date you then need to form a picture of the market. This is
best done with the swing chart. If the one day chart is unclear then expand the time
framebyusingatwodayswingchart.Gann’sruleofthree,andexpandingor
decreasing time and price ranges are important to monitor. When determining main tops
and bottoms the balancing of time periods, time cycles, price cycles and pattern are
critical. It is very easy to identify a cycle culmination date and conclude that this is
wherethemarket“will”reverse.Itmay,butwhatismoreimportantisthatyouletthe
market show its hand and act only when all the required pieces fall into place. It is not
as important that you are right about what the market will do before the day of a trade
entry, but that you are right on the day.
Price
When a reversal date has been identified, and the market is forming lower tops, higher
bottoms or a main trend reversal, then the price level needs to be calculated that the
market is likely to stop and reverse at. Price cycle levels and the Gann percentages of
the previous range in the same direction, and these percentages applied to the range that
the market is currently trading within, relative to previous highs and lows, in addition to
the other price levels determined by percentages of the lows and highs will enable you
to identify where clusters of price levels are. Gann angles that intersect at these price
levels will add to the analysis of where support and resistance levels are.

Trade Entries and Exits
On the pressure dates that this system relies upon to make trade entries, intraday price
action can get you in very close to the actual top or bottom.
The first method of entering a trade from a pressure date is by using small time frame
bars such as 2 or more minutes. 4 minutes is 1 degree of 1 day. For short position trades,
when the intraday chart pattern forms a lower top, that is, has failed in an attempt to
take out the high and starts to decline, an entry can be made and a stop placed a little
above this failed high. Alternatively, using a O/H/L/C or candlestick bar, by watching
the market after it opens, if it trades up then starts to decline and pulls back below the
open, the trade can be entered with a stop placed above the high. This is usually best left
for about ¼ to ½ hour after a markets open. This is shown in the following chart, these
are the red bars.
With a long position, wait for the market to trade above its open or has made a higher
bottom on an intraday chart. Markets can move quickly on occasions, so an intraday
swing chart may not present an opportunity to enter a trade so be prepared to use both
methods.
In the following chart of the S&P 500, the arrows indicate where to enter a trade once
analysis has indicated a reversal date. The long trades are entered a little after the
market traded back above the open. The short entries are made when the market trades
below the days open. Intraday entries can be used if the intraday patterns allow for this.
In this chart at each of the turns there are time cycles present. Often on the day of the
reversal a clear entry signal is not given. By leaving the entry to the following day and
entering as the market traded above or below the open price on the day means that the
negative bias to the anticipated reversal has dissipated. In fast moving markets you will
need to act promptly to avoid missing the trade entirely. When a market trades above or
below its open price and also the open and close of the previous day it is a stronger
entry signal.

The range up from the 4/5/00 ended a little short of 75% of the immediate prior range,
and a little over 50% of the range coming off the main low.
What is present is what Gann emphasised. The aligning of time on the vertical axis,
price on the horizontal axis and the balancing of time and price at the diagonal.
The following chart is of the Australian SPI. It shows the lower high made on the
16/7/04. This date was at 84 and 168 calendar days, and at 30 and 120 solar degrees.
Importantly, it had failed to reach the 50% level of the previous range. The first daily
low from the high was also below the last low leading up to the high.
The following Monday signalled a short entry when the market traded below the open
and below the 3 points per day, or 3 x 1 Gann angle, from the 12/5/04. This is shown by
the arrow.
The position was closed on the day of the next low, the 26/7/04 at just a few points from
the low of 3469. This day was at 120 and 240 degrees from previous weekly turning
points. It was also at a 35 days repeating time period (this chart is on page 2 of the “time 
counts” section) The 33 point range is 3/8th or 37.5% of 88.
 
 .
 
The following daily chart of CBA, an Australian bank shows the low on the 4th May
2000. This date was at 90 degrees from the 3rd February 2000. You would have had this
date marked as 90 degrees on the chart beforehand. The low on the 4th May 2000 was at
a range down of 143 points from the high on 26th April 2000. 144 is an important
numbermentionedin“PriceCycles”.Thepricesupportlevel was at 33.3% of the main
range, and time and price squared out at 7 points per day or at a 7 x 1 angle. The actual
low at $25.20 is 4 times 630, or 7 times 360. The chart had shown it was in an uptrend
by the successive higher lows and higher highs. A trade entry could have been made
near the close of the day.

In the following chart of the Australian SPI; A, B and D show SHORT trades. They are
in the direction of the trend and each of these reversal days would have been calculated
by using timing methods. Entries are made as the market trades below the open, on the
day or the following day in A. C could have been a short trade, however three waves or
sections had completed, so caution would have been in order.
1 to 7 show LONG trades. They are in the direction of the trend, entries are made as the
market trades above the open on the day or the following day. The first four ranges up
were very close to the previous ranges. Trade 4 did not continue the previous pattern
and a small loss would have resulted. Trade 6 would have locked in profits by use of a
trailing STOP. Trade 7 did not follow thru and small loss would have resulted. Below is
the swing chart of the previous chart. A weekly swing chart used in conjunction with the
1 day swing chart showed that main trend was up. At “1” the weekly trend continuation 
had been confirmed.

The main or weekly high and low points can be determined by the important cycle
numbers, 631, 668, 840, 1262, 1290, 1336 days and 630, 668, 840, 1260, 1290 and 1336
degrees. These are marked on each time count line if using a hand drawn chart. They
can also be calculated once a weekly high or low has occurred by setting up a
spreadsheet table with the reference date and the forecasted dates calculated.
Money Management
Moneymanagementrulesarecriticaltoprotectyourtradingcapital.Gann’smethod
was to never outlay or have at risk more than 10% of his total trading account. This way,
he said, he would have had to have 10 losing trades before he lost all his capital.
The Trading Plan
You need to set up a system to document your analysis. You can do this by listing the
cycles present on the day of the reversal, the support or resistance level at the turning
point with the Gann angles and the price retracements or projection percentages.
Always keep records of trading information such as the date, time, price, and quantity
and market position of your order.
Handy Hints
Be cautious with other peoples advice. Be responsible for your trading decisions. The

The simplest way to trade is to calculate the possible reversal dates and price levels by
using the key cycle numbers and coordinating them with the swing chart. Always
considering the main trend with the swing charts, at Time and Price alignments, when
you have a higher swing bottom, then BUY. When you have a lower swing top, then
SELL.Thepricelevelstodothisatonthesedaysaredetailedinthe“Supportand
Resistancelevels”section.
Below is the type of market setups to watch for. On a TIME cycle date, if PRICE has
reached an important support or resistance level, and intraday, the market is reacting
back in the direction of the main trend, then a trade can be entered.
Deciding to take profits intraday or holding the trade for longer can be decided on the
day based on factors prevailing at the time. One strategy is to close half the position and
place a stop near entry.
Using the earlier sections to calculate precise time and price levels can be done,
however by combining the two most important factors as in the below chart and letting
the market tell you what it is doing, much less analysis is required.
My approach to trading is to select a group of markets that meet my criteria as detailed
inthe“markets”section.Imonitor these markets regularly to find a market that is
exhibiting the patterns I prefer. Once I have found a market that appears to be ready for
a move I then check for the Time and Price cycle alignments. The next step is to
monitor the markets live price action and enter the trade according to the signal
generated at the time.

Below is the same scenario for a short position. 3 is below 1, 4 is below 2, the day
closed below its open price, or the 2nd day from 4 caused the swing chart to turn down.
Stops are placed above 4.
 
 .
 
The following chart shows what can be one of the most reliable types of trades. It
includes trend, price and time. Selecting these types of setups and using sensible money
management rules will ensure safe and profitable trading. The basic rules are; trend
direction confirmed by 3 being above 1. 4 being a cycle date and retracing 50% or less
of 2 to 3 and the following day trading comfortably above its open price with good
volume. Stops are placed below 4.

W.D.GANN’STWENTY-FOUR NEVER-FAILING RULES
1. Amount of capital to use: Divide your capital into 10 equal parts and never risk more than one-tenth of
your capital in any one trade.
2.U se stop loss orders. Always protect a trade when you make it with a stop loss order 3 to 5 points away.
3.N ever overtrade. This would be violating your capital rule.
4.N ever let a profit run into a loss. After you have made a profit or 3 points or more, raise your stop loss
order so that you will have no loss of capital.
5.D o not buck the trend. Never buy or sell if you are not sure of the trend according to your charts.
6.Whenindoubt,getout,anddon’tgetinwhenindoubt.
7.T rade only in active stocks. Keep out of slow, dead ones.
8. Equal distribution of risk. Trade in 4 or 5 stocks, if possible. Avoid tying up all your capital in any one
stock.
9.N ever limit your orders or fix a buying or selling price. Trade at the market.
10.Don’tcloseyourtradeswithoutgoodreason.Followupwithastoplossordertoprotectyourprofits.
11. Accumulate a surplus. After your have made a series of successful trades, put some money into
surplus account to be used only in emergency or times of panic.
12.Ne ver buy just to get a dividend.
13.Ne ver average a loss. This is one of the worst decisions a trader can make.
14. Never get out of the market just because you have lost patience or get into the market just because you
are anxious from waiting.
15.Av oid taking small profits and big losses.
16.Ne ver cancel a stop loss order after you have placed it at the time you make a trade.
17.Av oid getting in and out of the market too often.
18. Be just as willing to sell short as you are to buy. Let your object be to keep with the trend and make
money.
19.Ne ver buy just because the price of a stock is low or sell short just because the price is high.
20. Be careful about pyramiding at the wrong time. Wait until the stock is very active and has crossed
resistance levels before buying more.
21. Select the stocks with small volume of shares outstanding to pyramid on the buying side and the ones
with the largest volume of stock outstanding to sell short.
22. Never hedge. If you are long one stock and it starts to go down, do not sell another stock short to
hedge it. Get out at the market; take your loss and wait for another opportunity.
23.Ne ver change your position in the market without good reason. When you make a trade, let it be for
some good reason or according to some definite plan; then do not get out without a definite indication of a
change in trend.
24.Av oid increasing your trading after a long period of success or a period of profitable trades.

“Charts are records of past market movements. The future is but a 
repetition of the past. There is nothing new. As the bible says, “The thing 
that hath been, it is that which shall be”. History repeats and with charts 
and rules, we determine when and how it is going to repeat. Therefore, the
first and most important point to learn is how to make charts correctly
because, if you make an error in the chart, you will make an error in
applying the rules to your trading”.WD Gann.
On a chart set out in calendar day format, that is, leaving gaps for each non trading day
of the year and at each significant turning point –a weekly chart will be a guide as to
these points. Mark on these dates on the chart, or below the date axis on the bottom of
the chart, the date and solar degree of the month. By counting forward from these dates
the important numbers of 1262, 1290 and 1336 days and 1260, 1290 and 1336 degrees
and their 1/8th divisions you will know what dates in the future are to be further
analysed using time periods and price cycle levels, to determine if a reversal is likely.
When a previously recognisable time period is occurring on one of these time cycle
dates then that date is a more likely date on which a reversal will occur. Some of these
time periods that often occur in all markets are 49, 52, 144, 168, 191, 224, 372, 666, 888,
days and multiples and 1/8th divisions of these numbers.
When writing in time counts use a fine point pen or pencil for clarity and for solar
degrees use a different colour so these numbers can be easily seen. Start the time counts
from each new weekly turn. Placing a coloured sticker above or below the reference
point will easily identify reference points when a chart becomes large. Continue time
counts for 1336 degrees into the future. Underline the numbers that are at each new
significant high or low point. Keep these time counts continued in advance so that as the
market trades into these numbers already on the chart you will be aware of the cycles
and time periods beforehand. Then on the date or a day or two beforehand refer to the
swing chart for market pattern and the price support and resistance levels.
When calculating the horizontal support and resistance levels of the key cycles initially
apply the 50% level then the others as required as the market trades into the area. Price
cycles when intersecting with a time cycle date and a time period date are where and
when reversals are more likely to occur. Where a price cycle level is close to a division
of a range using Gann percentages or Fibbonacci levels then it is more important. Also
apply the range percentages using the swing chart which can be drawn at the far right of
the chart at the same scale to the bar chart.
 
 .
 
24. Charts
```

### Page 135

```
When applying Gann angles calculate at least three points before drawing in any line.
As an example, after 30 days out from a high or low, mark where the line will intersect
30 points below or above the starting point, then 60 days out, mark on the chart where
the line will intersect 60 points above or below the starting point, and then 90 days out,
mark where 90 points up or down is, then draw the line connecting the three points. It
should, from the original point intersect the three points exactly. Do this in pencil at first
for most lines, so they can be erased and so as to not excessively clutter the chart.
When an important high or low point occurs, initially draw the angle that best fits with
the markets current position. This may be a 4 points per 1 day angle or more if the
market is moving away sharply. Adding angles in 1 point increments can be useful, such
as 1 x 1, 2 x 1, 3 x 1, 4 x 1, 5 x 1, 6 x 1, 7 x 1, 8 x1, 9 x 1, etc.
Write in the weekly price ranges above and below the weekly turning points on the bar
chart and the swing chart, in red for down ranges and blue/black for up ranges. Price
ranges have a tendency to repeat. They will be related to the numbers related to the
cycles and percentages of these cycles and to the previous ranges in the same direction.
By adding them together they will also relate to cycle numbers. When straight line
ranges and previous ranges in either direction are added together they will also relate to
the cycle numbers. These are cumulative ranges. A good example of this is the S&P 500
where the 1984 to 2000 range was 1412, the next range down to 2002 was 807, and the
range up to 3rd January 2005 was 454, 1412 + 807 + 454 = 2673 or 2 x 1336. On this
day at 1221, 807 + 454 = 1261. Additionally it was at a 1262 day, 1260 and 630 degree
date. Having these important cycles present in time and price was a very powerful
indication of this reversal. This concept can be used in any time or price frame.
Swing charts or the trend indicator can be constructed in different ways. The bar chart
with an accompanying box style swing chart in the same scale is best. The days taken
for each range, the price ranges and the support and resistance levels can be marked on
this chart as well. A swing overlay can be applied to the bar chart, it will serve the same
purposebutdon’tclutterthemainchart.
A business/financial calculator is very useful for calculating dates in the past and
forward. The Sharp EL-735 is suitable. Dates can be calculated in the MS Excel
spreadsheet on the accompanying CD. This spreadsheet table can be created by placing
in cell A1 the reference date to be calculated from, in cell B1 put 631, in cell C1 put the
formulaeof“=sum(A1+B1)”.Dothisfor631,668,1262,1290and 1336 days. 630,
668, 1260, 1290 and 1336 solar degrees will be at dates further on calculated by using
an ephemeris.
You will need an ephemeris for calculation of solar degrees. When calculating 668°,
add 660° to the reference date to determine the month, and then add another 8°. Use the
same procedure for 1336°. When calculating the 30 solar degree dates for the cycle of
360°, go to the next month and locate the degree date that is the closest to the one you
are referencing from. If it is on a weekend, or other non trading day then the reaction
will occur on the closest trading day to the calculated date but watch both the Monday
and Friday.
To apply the timing calculations to computer charts you will need a calendar day and a
solar degree count tool. By setting the degree counter to intervals of 30° you will pick
up the 1/12th sections of the 360° cycle. This same method can also be used with the
degree counts for 668 and 1336 degrees. The calendar day counter is set to 631 day
increments and 668 days to calculate these times.

price value of 10,080 or 8 times 1260.
Subtracting the bear market range of 4,673 or 3.5 cycles of 1336 from 10,080 results in
5,407. Add 5,407 to the October 2002 low of 7,180 results in a price level of 12,587.
This is just 8 points short of the target level of 12,579.
By calculating multiples of the other cycles and using similar calculations you will
forecast other price levels at where reversals can occur.
Familiarity with the main cycles would have forewarned of the 20th February 2007

Of all the techniques used in technical analysis, the use of time cycles is the only
method that allows you to project and anticipate a time in the future where a market
may change its trend.
This is possible because price action unfolds in repetitive rhythms over time. WD Gann
used his knowledge of cycles to make incredibly accurate market forecasts. Because a
cycle literally refers to a circle, Gann knew that the harmonic divisions of the circle
would be accurate in determining the important divisions of a circle.
Time and Price progress according to the same cycles. Gann stated that time and price
can be treated in the same way. Time is measured on a chart from a reference point left
to right. Price is measured as it moves upward or downward from a reference point. The
important increments in which to make these measurements are the key cycles detailed.
Gann was an avid reader of the bible. He stated in his romantic novel Tunnel thru the
Air that everything one needed to know could be found in the bible. The key cycles and
their method of application detailed in the preceding pages are to be found in biblical
references.
Biblical prophecynumbersusethe“dayforayear”principle.Thatis,thenumberssuch
as 1260, 1290 or 1336 can be used to calculate any time unit including solar degrees.
The number 1,000 was also detailed as a cycle in Tunnel thru the Air. Note the DJIA
chart on page 135 and the 1,000 day time period from this markets high in January 2000
to the October 2002 low.
Prophecy numbers intersect both smaller and larger numbers of like kind, on both a one

365.25 - Earths cycle, and 1260 and 1290 are both derived from the symbolic Hebrew
360 days to a year.
It has commonly been used by Gann analysts to base most cyclical calculations on the
number 360. However as has been shown the best use of this number is when it is used
in its biblical interpretations of 1260 and 1290.
The bible refers to“atime,times,andahalfatime”regarding the prophetic number 360.
It is described in the bible how the number 1290 is the prophetic 1260 with the addition
of the leap month of 30 days added to it. That is why on occasions the number 390 is
also important. Also anything that is repeated three times in the bible is exceptionally
important. Gann stated in Tunnel thru the Air thatthe“threedaysandthreenightsinthe
bellyofthewhale”from Jonahwasmostimportant.Youwillfind“triple”numbers
such as 666 and 888 often are present at reversals.
Why do markets react to biblical numbers? Biblical numbers indicated a span of time
that passed before things came to an end or then began a new beginning. It may be
simply no more than the collective unconscious of traders recognising numbers that
symbolically indicated endings and beginnings. The planetary cycles appear to have
their cyclical rhythm embedded in our behaviour also and they often add to the effects
of biblical numbers at times of market reversals.
