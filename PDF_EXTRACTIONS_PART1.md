I found this post somewhere on the web. Its thought provoking if nothing else. Gann was 
into numerology. 
 
In numerolgy you want to find the number vibration by adding up the digits to bring it down to a 
single digit. For example if you have the number 2417 you add up the single digits [2+4+1+7 = 
14=1+4 =5 So the number 2417 dances to the vibration of 5. 
Now the circle is 360 degrees if you break it up into 30 degrees increments you have 30 60 90 
120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 and 360… now if you break each number down to a single 
digit then you have a pattern or symetry working..3 6 9 3 6 9 3 6 9 3 6 9. Now you might say so 
what. Look at the pattern in percentages of price movement(Read W.D Gann..45 Years in Wall 
Street} 
 
3.125 =  2   43.75  =  1  84.375=  9 
 
6.25  =  4   46.875 =  3  87.5  =  2 
 
9.375 =  6   50     =  5  90.625=  4 
 
12.5  =  8   53.125 =  7  93.75 =  6 
 
15.625=  1   56.25  =  9  96.875=  8 
 
18.75 =  3   59.375 =  2  100   =  1 
 
21.875=  5   62.5   =  4 
 
25    =  7   65.625 =  6 
 
28.125=  9   68.75  =  8 
 
31.25 =  2   71.875 =  1 
 
34.375=  4   75     =  3 
 
37.5  =  6   78.125 =  5 
 
40.625=  8   81.25  =  7 
See the percentages table when broken down to a single digit the percentage move to a perfect 
Yin and Yang pattern of order starting from Even digit to Odd digits and back to Even and then 
Back to Odd digits. 
Gann mentions in 45 years of Wall Street that the percentages was the one of the greatest 
discoveries he made.Now lets look at the number 144... 
when we bring it down to a single digit it comes to 9..so change of price or time can occur.So the 
following digits 18 36 54 72 90 108 126 144 bring to single digit = 9 .This applies in time and 
price. But you must go and back test these numbers on ranges in price,multiples of 144 
For example look at the price of the stock when it is at 144 288 432 and so on.Also when the 
market of a particular stock is say for instance is at 2999 then look for the next resistance or 
support by adding 144 and wait for conformation wether it will move into the next square of 144 
If 144 is to much for that particular stock then do divisions of 144...18 36 54 72..... 
Study the number 144 more you will find it all ties into square of nine.You then needto go and 
back test these numbers on past history of a stock on a chart.The answers are all there one needs 
to put in the effort and you will see and discover more. kind regards to all

Hello David 
Thanks for the email Look at the number 144.if you do a bit of study on numerolgy to find the 
real value of the vibration of the number you need to bring it down to a single digit.  
So if you add the digits 144{1+4+4 =9}So when a number reaches 9 it has to change back to 1 
again.18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 99 108 117 126 135 and 144 all add up to 9 when you bring it 
down to a single digit. 
When you look at a circle it has 360 degrees start from the cardinal points we have 0 90 180 270 
360 now all these numbers add up to 9 when you bring it down to a single digit...now the trine 
points of the circle which is the 45 degrees to the cardinal points which of course is 90 ... 
so the trine points of the circle are 45 135 225 315 now each number here adds up to 9.... 
change occurs so in relation to the stock market go back test time and price .W.D Gann stated 
then go back test the history of the stock and prove it to yourself that the numbers keep on 
coming in.Also use time periods of 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 360 .. 
now if you bring these numbers to a single digit you will see a pattern of symetry 3 6 9..3 6 9 3 6 
9 3 6 9 ... 
in regards to % movement in price use the percentage number of  
3.125 equals 2  
6.25 equals 4  
9.375 equals 6  
12.5 equals 8  
15.625 equals 1  
18.75 equals 3  
21.875 equals 5  
25 equals 7  
28.125 equals 9  
31.25 equals 2  
34.375 equals 4  
37.5 equals 6  
40.625 equals 8  
43.75 equals 1  
46.875 equals 3  
50 equals 5  
53.125 equals 7  
56.25 equals 9  
59.375 equals 2  
62.5 equals 4  
65.625 equals 6  
68.75 equals 8  
71.875 equals 1  
75 equals 3  
78.125 equals 5
```

### Page 3

```
81.25 equals 7  
84.375 equals 9  
87.5 equals 2  
90.625 equals 4  
93.75 equals 6  
96.875 equals 8  
100 equals 1 
now you can see the symetry .But dont believe me go test it out for you self mathematics and 
Geomtry applied to the market reveals the Truth. 
Study study apply and prove it to yourself the biggest obstacle in one life is each individuals 
human conditioning and flawed way of thinking base on human emotion . 
To tap into the Universal Truth one needs to vibrate the same frequencies.....kill the ego embrace 
your realself {SPIRIT} and hang on for the time of your life.

## PDF 2: Gann's Master Time Factor (Flanagan)

W. D. Gann’s Master Time Factor RevealedBy James Flanagan a Time great that published deal has
made of done mystery books him a an great and alleged has deal the been in stock $50 adding 
attached million and tocommodity the in to prots legend his methods during of courses W.D. his of
Gann he trading. career. updated and Yet, the It is trading over despite often the asserted
 methods  his years,  four that Gann either did not reveal the most important of his secrets, or 
obscured them in his courses with very little explanation.
For vendors of trading systems and approaches, this has been used very effectively as a
marketing tool in selling the “secrets” to W.D. Gann’s success. After all, the search for the “holy
grail” plays on all of our emotions, and our as sense of greed.
While we also have proted from the name of Gann, we believe Gann did reveal his
most valuable forecasting technique, and spelled it out in clear language. Its value can only
be appreciated by those willing to prove its effectiveness by looking back over hundreds of
years of data in each market.
When Gann said, “I have more income than I can spend for my needs, therefore, my only
object in writing this book is to give others the most valuable gift possible - KNOWLEDGE”, we
believe he was sincere. Our research to date, suggests that Gann’s greatest gift was his discovery
of what he referred to the Master Time Factor. In his various course he refers to the Master Time
Factor alternately as Time Cycles, Major Cycles, Master Time Periods, Extreme Great Cycles
and Law of Vibration. It is important that we provide a compelling argument from Gann’s own
published works, of why we believe that this was his most valuable contribution.
First off, it stands to reason that he would charge the highest price for his most valuable
instruction. In the 1930’s, he offered a series of three courses which he made available at $500,
$1000 and $3000. Needless to say, a cost of $3000 in 1930 dollars was a very steep $20,000 in
today’s dollars. The third course differed from his other courses in one major respect, it included
his “secret discovery of the Master Time Factor”. This he stated clearly in the sales brochure he
provided for those requesting information about his courses.
In this course, he lists the twelve things to look up before you make a trade. Heading
the list at #l is, “Annual Forecast determines year of Time Cycles, whether bull or bear
year and main trend of the general market up or down.” This was the Master Time Factor.
It is listed as #I because it is of primary importance. It is what makes many of his other
rules understandable.
Reviewing some of his claims: “The law of vibration enabled me to accurately determine the
exact points to which stocks and commodities should rise and fall.” “ By studying time cycles,

you will learn why tops and bottoms are formed at certain times.” “In order to be accurate we
must know the major cycles.” “Always consider the annual forecast and whether the big time
limit has run out before judging a reverse move.”
This chastening by Gann to his students, is backed up by some of the most spectacular
forecasts of highs and lows in history during Gann’s 50-year trading career. His prediction
of the top for stocks in 1929 within three days, followed by a panic, is a matter of record. He

Gann’s Master Mathematical Formula For Market Predictions
Master Mathematical Price Time and Trend Calculator
By Daniel T. Ferrera
In 1954, at the age of nearly 76, W.D. Gann released a course based upon mathematical 
rules for making market predictions. In the advertisement for this method the author of the add 
writes: “We will not sell the course of instructions or teach the mathematical formula for 
market predictions just to get money, which we do not need or have to have; we will only sell the 
courses to people wh meet our requirements, and if we feel after a thorough investigation that a 
man or woman cannot make a success investing or trading we will refuse to teach them the 
courses”.  “The Master Calculator can only be used with the Master Courses. It is not sold 
separate from the other courses”.  The price shown for Gann’s Master Course in this ad is 
$5,000.00, it does not list the additional cost of the Master Mathematical Calculator. The ad 
describes the calculator as a plastic overlay that accurately measures Time, Price and Trend. 
Many Gann experts and students have tried to use these overlays, which require the chart to be 
hand drawn to a proper scale on graph paper that has 8 squares to one inch. This creates a lot 
of extra tedious work. This has caused one of Gann’s greatest discoveries to have been 
overlooked for many years. I know that some software programs have the ability to make these 
overlays on price charts but that is still not going to help most people because it turns out that 
there are also very precise mathematical rules regarding the horizontal axis or Time! In fact, 
these same mathematical rules apply to price as well but we will leave this topic for latter. The 
advertisement itself contains clues about the calculator, such as “W.D. Gann’s Record for 52 
years”, “After fifty-two years of experience and research going back hundreds of years, I have 
proved to my entire satisfaction that history repeats and that when we know the past, we can 
determine the future of prices”. The calculator that Gann is talking about in this ad is his 
square of 52 overlay, which is based upon the 52 weeks in a year. The basic overlay looks like 
this:
```

### Page 2

```
This is also the same geometric form that Gann used for the Square of 90 and Square of 
144 plastic overlays. This basic structure or overlay appears in many books on Sacred 
Geometry and is also the secret to George Bayer’s “Trend Determination” course. Getting back 
to Gann and the square of 52 course we find that this is the course where Gann made the 
confusing statement: “ Within the circle forms the square, there is an inner circle and an inner 
square, as well as an outer square and an outer circle which prove the Fourth Dimension in 
working out price movements”. This quote is describing a fractal nature or structural pattern 
existing in the markets that is the same on smaller levels as it is at larger levels. 
Jumping over to Gann’s Angle course, on the last page, GA-32, Gann says: “Figuring 
$100, or par, as a basis for stock prices and changing these prices to degrees, 12½ = 45-degrees, 
25 = 90-degrees, 37½= 135-degrees, 50 = 180-degrees, 62½ = 225-degrees, 75 = 270-degrees, 82½ 
= 315-degrees, and 100 = 360”. This tiny little paragraph is the basis of the entire Murrey Math 
Trading Course, which readers of Traders World should be very familiar with since, T.H. 
Murrey has written numerous articles for the magazine. These numbers are all natural 8th
numbers off of the base of 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, etc.  The part that is most confusing is 
balancing this with the time element, but based on the information given by Gann himself it 
should be obvious that he has already shown us part of the relationship. For example: If shares 
of XYZ stock moved up 12½ dollars in 45 days, weeks or 45 months then the stock is on the 
price degree of it’s time angle, that is to say that price and time are equal or balanced. Gann’s 
example: “When a stock sells at 50 on the 180th day, week or month, it is on the degree of its 
time angle”. “On February 1, 1915, U.S. Steel made a low at $38, which is closest to a price of
```

### Page 3

```
$37½, which is 3/8th of 100 and equals 135-degree angle. Steel was 14 years or 168 months old on 
February 25, 1915, and hit the angle of 135-degrees, which showed that the price of Steel was 
behind time, but was in a strong position, holding at $38 above the 135-degree angle or the price 
$37½”. Just to make sure that you understand this information, U.S. Steel would have been 
balanced or “on the degree of its time angle” at a price of $46 5/8th because $100/ 360-degrees = 
0.27777cents per degree and 168 months multiplied by 0.27777 = $46.67 which is closest to $46 
or 5/8th in price. Therefore, Steel is $8 5/8th behind time. T.H. Murrey has his time rules based 
off the “Harvest Moon” but I would stick to W.D. Gann’s time definitions when using this 
natural 8th system and his plastic overlays as his method has a clear degree relationship to both 
price and time and also to the fractal structure, which he described in the quote mentioned 
above.  I will discuss how to set up these charts properly in terms of time latter in the article 
with specific examples. Gann goes on to say: “When Steel reached $200, it equaled 2 circles of 
360-degrees (two complete cycles of $100). When it advanced to $261¾, it was closest to $62½ 
(5/8th) in the third cycle of $100 or nearest the 225-degree angle or 5/8th point, which is the 
strongest angle after it crossed the half-way point at $250 or the 180-degree angle”. Note that 
Gann rejects the two circles or cycles of $100 price to convert the time angle. These instructions 
are also very different than what Murrey Math instructs students to do but I do not want to get 
into that subject.
Moving on to the subject of time we know that Gann placed great emphasis on the 
cardinal points of the solar year. These are the Vernal Equinox, Summer Solstice, Autumnal 
Equinox and Winter Solstice or March 21st, June 21st, September 21st, and December 21st
respectively.  Gann always said that the year begins at March 21st (not January 1st) and that this 
was a very important seasonal time.  Now this is where Gann’s “within the circle forms the 
square” quote gets real interesting! If we treat each natural year (March 21st to March 21st) as a 
complete circle, which it is because the earth has gone 360-degrees around the Sun, and take 
W.D. Gann at his word that there is a square within this orbit then we come up with some very 
unique geometrical information about time and squares, i.e. Gann’s plastic overlays. Lets build 
a hypothetical square running from Vernal Equinox to Vernal Equinox as our horizontal axis 
and we will use 0 to 100 as our vertical. If we draw in the two 45-degree Angles corner to corner 
we have a shape that looks like a box with an x in it. The two 45’s will meet at the exact center of 
both price and time at $50 on the Autumnal Equinox or September 21st. If we bisect this square 
again with a horizontal line going left to right at $50, and a vertical line going straight up from 
the Autumn Equinox we can create four smaller squares with half of the x already completed. If 
we complete these smaller boxes with the missing 45-degree line we will find that these points 
come out at $25 and $75 in price and also 25% and 75% in time or Sumer Solstice to Winter 
Solstice (June 21st to December 21st).  If we take these 4 points, which are $25 on June 21st, $75 
on June 21st, $25 on December 21st and $75 on Decembers 21st and make a new square, we find 
that our new square is exactly half the size of our former square set within the ¼ points in terms 
of both price and time. Our new square also maintains the exact center of our old square at $50. 
This new square is now an exact musical octave of the old square because it’s based upon 
powers of 2 or is exactly ½ our old square. This tells us that if we want to find a square that is 
within our old square that we will only find it between the two Solstice points in the year! If we 
wanted to enlarge the original square (to find an outer square) we would again follow the 
natural law of the musical octave, i.e. powers of 2. The first part of the problem is easy because 
we know that the next square is going to be twice as large as our old square. So this means that 
we are moving up from a one-year square to a two-year square in terms of time but this does
```

```
not answer where in time this new square begins and ends. To calculate where this larger 
square begins and ends we have to use the rule “as above so below”. In other words, when we 
made the smaller square, we found that it existed within the larger square at the 25% and 75% 
points in time, therefore March 21st to March 21st is within the ¼ points of the larger square 
above it. In our one-year square, a ¼ of time is 90-degrees or 91.3125 solar days. This means 
that a ¼ of time in the next larger square is 180-degrees or 182.625 solar days, i.e. twice as big. 
If we add and subtract 180-degrees/days from our smaller square running March to March, we 
will find that our two-year square begins and ends at the Autumnal Equinox. The same is true 
for a 4-year, 8-year, 16-year square, etc. Getting back to the inner squares, a 90-degree square 
(1/2 of our 180-degree Summer Solstice to Winter Solstice and winter back to summer circle) 
would begin and end 45-degrees after the Sumer Solstice and 45-degrees before the Winter 
Solstice because 45 is ¼ of 180. This would be 45.65 days or ¼ of 182.625. So this means we 
would have another (90-degree) square running inside the (180-degree) Solstice squares 
beginning on August 5th and ending November 5th. Then just as we have two 180-degree Solstice 
squares running from Summer to Winter, then Winter back to Summer, we also have four 90-
degree squares running from August 5th to November 5th, November 5th to February 5th, 
February 5th to May 5th and May 5th  back to August 5th. These are all exact mathematical points 
to look for squares based upon Gann’s plastic overlay pattern. I am providing two charts of the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average (closing price only) so that you can visually see what Gann was 
describing in his Square of 52 course. Anyone interested in studying Gann, should purchase 
their materials from Brad Stewart at Sacred Science Institute (www.Sacredscience.com), as I 
have found them to contain many unique sections of information that is not provided by others 
selling Gann related material. I have made many of my best discoveries, including the 
information presented in this article, from the course materials provided by the Sacred Science 
Institute!

“ Within the circle forms the square, there is an inner circle and an inner square, as well as an 
outer square and an outer circle which prove the Fourth Dimension in working out price 
movements”. 
Please note that the inner square is an exact musical octave of the larger outer square.

Price-Time Universe
 
written by Sergey Tarasov June 3, 2016
 
Introduction
In this article I would like to explain the technique that has been introduced 7 years ago (in 2009); at that time I have tended considering this approach as a totally experimental one. I still consider this technique as an experimental. During these 7 years
I have got some back feed from users regarding this module. So I decided to review this module with some attempt to find a rational explanation of this technique.
First step: 2D price time vector
The first step is a simple geometric measurement.  We calculate the Sun movement between two important turning points on March 6, 2009 and April 26, 2010. It is 410 degrees. Then we calculate the price movement within this period; it is 553
points. So, we can calculate the length of the vector that connects these two turning points; it is 688. This chart explains this idea:
 
 
This is a very important step, and I would like to explain in details what it really means. As a physicist, I have to do that.
De facto it means that we accept the  fact that price and time can be considered as a kind of space, a kind of time-price unity. This is not a simple physical process when the price is changing inside a time domain (like air temperature or pressure
changes in time, and we simply record these changes). No, it is more complicated as we delegate to the price the quality of space . Price does not changes in regards to the time; it changes due to the involvement of a human being (a trader) who
walks in this time-price Universe, though in regards to the time it is a one way road.
 Why is it so important to accept (or not accept) this fact? Simply because the acceptance or not acceptance of this fact gives us an ability to apply or not apply the mathematics. Usually the academic science prefers not working with the price
directly, using instead some normalized values like oscillators or percentage of daily gains, etc. It sets the price in a Procrustean bed of normalized/uniformed values, as an inevitable result of this procedure is that we can forecast timing but not price
values. Possibly for the next step we have to loose our academic virginity (but not the scientific common sense).
 Some analogy can be found in the evolution of science. More than 100 years ago Herman Minkowski  introduced four-dimensional spacetime manifold  that incorporates space and time in one coordinate system. This simple formalism helped Albert
Einstein to develop famous Einstein field equations. General theory of relativity shows how gravitation affects our four dimensional spacetime Universe making it curved. To build the building of new post-Newtonian physics, we have to interpolate our
Universe as four dimensional spacetime, we cannot separate this unity.
Now in 21 century this fact is very obvious for everybody. For example, look at what we can read in Wikipedia:
"Astronomers in the US have measured the distance of the farthest known galaxy, finding that its light took 13.1 billion years to reach Earth – which means the light was emitted just 700 million years after the Big Bang. Although the
galaxy is much smaller than the Milky Way, it is forming stars at a much faster...; Oct 23, 2013" 
You easily understand that this galaxy is located 13.1 billion years from Earth - this is space distance. At the same time, we understand that we are looking at OUR OWN history 13.1 billion years ago, 700 million years after Big Bang - this is time
distance.
Why I have to use so many words about that? You see, if we accept the fact that price has a quality of space, we may try to apply another model. As a simple example, we can calculate some formula that describes some market move in regards to
price; instead of creating a function like Sinus(time), we could use Sinus(price). Right now, in all 600+ K lines of Timing Solution code, you will not find this formula, as we cannot compare oranges (price) and apples (angles).
 
Second step: price time ratio - information speed
Now we have to set up the ratio between price and time domains. In example above we used a scale where 1 point of S&P500 corresponds to 1 degree of the Sun movement. For Dow Jones it would be better to use another ratio: 10 points of DJII
movement corresponds to 1 degree of Sun movement. Back to Minkowski spacetime manifold, the role of scaling coefficient between time and space plays the speed of light. And I would like to clarify one nuance here (this is a quote from
Wikipedia):
"According to special relativity, c is the maximum speed at which all matter and hence information in the universe can travel. It is the speed at which all massless particles ...."   You see, we speak more about information than speed itself, how fast the
information can be delivered. BTW, pay attention: they speak about massless particles because mass becomes infinity around the speed of light.
Ok, almost done. The last question is about metric formula, how to calculate the distance between two points in our new pricetime Universe. For example above, we used this formula, the distance between two points 1 and 2 calculates this way:
 
 
The time here is measured in the Sun movement units, so (Sun 2 - Sun 1) means the increment in the Sun position within this period. For example, within one year the Sun makes one full cycle through Ecliptic, i.e. 360 degrees; for ten years it is 3600
degrees, etc.

### Page 2

```
For Dow it is better to scale the price as 1 degree of the Sun movement corresponds to 10 points of Dow change, so the distance between two points 1 and 2 is calculated this way:
Pay attention, the distance between points in our pricetime Universe is calculated in degrees of the Sun (or any other planet's) movement. You will see later why this metrics is more convenient. And last note a-la physicist: the signature of this metrics
is (+,+) which means that we consider price and time as similar dimensions, like we will work with two kinds of time, two dimensions of time. In the next section I will explain why this is important.
 
Equidistant circle
Now, let 's go back to our first chart. We have calculated there the distance between two turning points 1 and 2; it is 688 degrees of the Sun movement. You can plot all points with the same 688 degrees distance from initial point 1:
 
Regarding the metric signature: if we assume that the signature for our pricetime Universe is (+1,-1), i.e. price is a kind of space, the equidistant curve will look this way:
It does not look logical to me, so I have decided to use (+1,+1) pricetime space with ellipses provided by this approach (ellipses - because this is a widely used figure of technical analysis).
 
Scaling
In this example we use scaling ratio 1degree of the Sun movement=$1 of S&P500 movement. Let's modify this ratio a little and set it to 1 degree=$0.934419. This is the chart we get:

```

### Page 3

```
The distance between these turning points is 720 degrees i.e. exactly two full cycles. Accordingly the equidistant circle is modified a bit, now it hits slightly different points of the price chart.
 
Harmonics
The same manner we can draw equidistant circles based on 360, 1080 (=3x360), 1440 (=4x360) degress. They look pretty much the same as standard concentric ellipses charting tools:
 
 
We can try to analyze these equidistant ellipses as some kind of information waves. Two important turning points are explained by two full waves (720 degrees). Ok, let's try also 360, 1080 etc. degrees ellipses, may be these ellipses bring some new
information for us ... just an idea.
 
Basic hypothesis
 As a basic hypothesis, we can use this: for a properly scaled chart, the distance between important turning points should form "good" angles like 180, 360,720 ... degrees  in our pricetime Universe. Plus harmonic waves may bring some important
information regarding the price movement as well.
 
Technology
We can describe the whole technology by three steps:
 
Step #1: Choose important turning points Let it be our turning points: bottom Mach 6, 2009 - to April 26, 2010.
 
Step #2:  Draw "2D Time-Price planetary distance/equidistant circles"  charting tool through these important turning points:
 
 
and try different planetary combinations there:

```

### Page 4

```
I recommend to start with:
 Sun (Sun-Sun combination) - pricetime Annual circles;
Sun-Mercury helio  - pricetime Mercury synodic circles;
Sun-Venus helio  - pricetime Venus synodic circles;
Sun-Mars helio  - pricetime Mars synodic circles.
Actually you can try any planetary combinations. For example, Sun-Mars geo circles look very interesting.
 
Step #3: scaling these circles and watch how these circles hit important turning points.
Click "H" button, and the program will show you the list of scaling coefficients that provide "good" distances between our turning points:
 
 
As an example I have selected Sun-Mars geo planetary combination as time metrics. Highlighting the first item, we set the scaling coefficient to 2.07946. The pricetime distance between our turning points will be 360 degrees:
 
and I got these equidistant circles:

```
This video explains how to do that:
 
 
IMHO, these figures should work as Fibonacci ellipses charting tools, so I do not dig into details here.  The advantage of this approach is that it provides the formal procedure: choose two turning points, check about a dozen of planetary
combinations, and for each planetary combination we have 1-3 scales that provide "good" distances between chosen turning points.  There are a few dozens (usually a dozen) variants that may be easily estimated from a trader's point of view.
 
Interference
If we accept that these cycles represent a kind of information waves in pricetime Universe, we are expecting to see interference between these waves. This video explains how to do that:

## PDF 6: SQ9 Hexagon Chart

Square of Nine
The Square of Nine can be considered as an exotic section in relation to Gann analysis.
Square of Nine Structure
Starting from the center(1) and following the numbers as they unwind, an infimite spiral becomes
apparent. Looking at lower right corner of the grid, you see the squares of odd
numbers...3,5,7,9,11..giving.. 9,25,49,81,121, with each square being a distinct Square within
the structure.
This tool is an effective marker of price support and resistance.
```

### Page 2

```
Here's how this structure becomes a calculator...
Find the number 15 on the Square of Nine . If a stock was trading at a price of $15, what are the
price objectives using a Gann Wheel? The number 15 is perfectly aligned under the zero and
360 degree angle marked on the top of the Wheel. Because the number 15 is aligned with zero
we need make no further adjustments, just read the Gann targets straight off the wheel. The 45
degree price objective from 15 is 17. It is the next number that aligns with the 45 degree line that
travels towards the top right corner. The number 19 crosses were the 90 degree line was drawn.
We would use the phrase, "$19 is 90 degrees up from $15." Now skip over to 180 degrees and
find $23 is directly opposite $15. We would still say, "23 is 180 degrees up from 15". At 270
degrees $28 is the price objective. A full 360 degrees up from 15 is $34. That is how a Gann
Wheel is used.
Why did we skip the bottom right corner angle which would be 135 degrees? Because like
Fibonacci, some calculations are more important than others. The Fibonacci ratios 0.382, 0.500.
0.618, 1.000, and 1.618 are relationships we know are the critical ratios to identify. This is also
how the various Gann angles are interpreted. We have a circle that is divided into quarters and
sixths, but we also need to divide 360 degrees into thirds because 120 degrees and 240 are
extremely important. The angles of greatest interest in financial markets are 45, 90, 120, 180,
240, 270, 315, and 360.
Sampels Usage of Square of 9
(1) Find potential turning point dates: count the # of calendar days between significant
A. high and low.
B. high to high
C. low to lwo .
Find that number on the Sq. of 9. Now note the numbers which are on the same angle as your
starting number, and watch for possible swings at those dates.
Example: A move for low A to low B takes up 39 calendars days. You locate the number 39 on
the square, and note the nubmers which are on the same angle. These would be:
```

### Page 3

```
67,105,150,201,262...
Now go back to your original low; you would look for another swing point at 67 calendar days
from this low, then 105 calendar days, etc.
(2) Calculate potential turning point prices: take the price of a major high/low and locate that
value on the Square. Note the values which are 45, 90, 120, 180, 240, 270, and 360 degrees on
the Square. If you are using a major low, you would note the numbers on those angles which are
greater than your starting value. If using a major high, you would use the numbers which are
lower.
Examples: S&P 500 07/24/2002 make a low at 775. You expect prices are going to rally and
want to find potential points of resistance as price move higher. locate 775 on the Square of 9
chart, and note the following angles:
45 deg. = 909
90 deg. = 909
120 deg. = 815,933
180 deg. = 832,952
240 deg. = 853,974
270 deg. = 861

Gann Hexagon Chart
The Hexagon Chart Structure
Let's see how Gann explains the Chart.
"Since everything moves in a circle and nothing moves in straight lines , this chart is to show to
you how the angles influence stocks at very low levels and very high levels and why stocks
move faster the higher they get , because they have moved out to where the distance between
the angles of 45* are so far apart that there is nothing to stop them and their moves are naturally
rapid up and down ."
We begin with a circle of “1” , yet the circle is 360* just the same . We then place a circle of
circles around this circle and six circles complete the second circle , making a gain of 6 over the
first one , ending the second circle at 7, making 7 on this angle a very important month, year ,
and week as well as days , the seventh day being sacred and a day of rest . The third circle is
completed at 19 . The fourth circle around is completed at 37 – a gain of 18 over the previous
circle . The fifth circle is completed at 61 , a gain of 24 over the previous circle . The sixth circle
is completed at 91 , a gain of 30 over the previous circle , and the seventh circle at 127 , a gain
```

### Page 6

```
of 36 over the last circle . Note that from the first the gain is 6 each time we go around . In other
words, when ‘is’ have traveled six times around we have gained 36 . Note that this completes
the first Hexagon and as this equals 127 months , shows why some campaigns will run 10 years
and seven months , or until they reach a square of the Hexagon , or the important last angle of
45* .
The eighth circle around is completed at 169 , a gain of 42 over the first . This is a very important
angle and an important time factor for more reasons than one . It is 14 years and one month , or
double our cycle of 7 years . Important tops and bottoms culminate at this angle as you will see
by going over your charts .
The ninth circle is completed at 217 , a gain of 48 over the previous circle . The tenth circle is
completed at 271 , a gain of 54 . Note that 271 is the ninth circle from the first , or is the third 90*
angle or 270* , three fourths of a circle , a strong point .. All this is confirmed by the Master
Twelve Chart , by the four seasons and by the Square of Nine Chart , and also confirmed by the
Hexagon chart ., showing that mathematical proof is always exact no matter how many ways or
from what directions you figure it .
The eleventh circle is completed at 331 , a gain of 60 over the last circle . The twelfth circle is
completed at 397 , which completes the Hexagon ., making a gain in 11 circles of 66 from the
beginning .
66 months , or 5 years and six months , marks the culmination of major campaigns in stocks .
Note how often they culminate on the 60th month , then have a reaction , and make a second
top or bottom in the 66th month . Note the number 66 on the Master Twelve Chart . Note it on
the Square of Nine and note that 66 occurs on an angle of 180* on the Hexagon chart , all of
which confirms the strong angle at this point .
We have an angle of 66* , one of 67.5* and one at 68 , confirming this point to be doubly strong
for tops and bottoms or space movements up or down .
Note the number 360* on the Hexagon Chart . It completes a circle of 360* . From our beginning
point this occurs at an angle of 180 * on the Hexagon Chart going around , but measuring from
the center , it would equal an angle of 90* or 180* , making this a strong point , hard and difficult
to pass, and the ending of one campaign and the beginning of another .
Again with the center of the Hexagon Chart at “1” notice that 7, 19, 37, 61, 91, 127, 169, 217,
271, 331, and 397 are all on this direct angle and are important points in time measurement .
Beginning with “1” and following the other angle , note that 2,9,22,41,66,97,134,177,226,281,
and 342 are all on a same angle of 90*, or an angle of 60* and 240* as measured by the
Hexagon Chart .
Go over this Chart and the important angles each way and you will see why the resistance is
met either on days , weeks, months or years, and why stocks stop and make tops and bottoms
at these strong important points according to time .
When any stock has passed out above 120* or especially above 127* or 127 points and gone
out of the square of the first Hexagon , its fluctuations will be more rapid and it will move faster
up and down . Notice near the center that in traveling from 66 to 7 you strike the angle of 180* or
90* , but when the stock gets out to 162, it can travel up to 169 before striking another strong
angle . That is why fast moves occur up and down as stocks get higher and as they move from a
center of time .
```

### Page 7

```
Remember that everything seeks the center of gravity and important tops and bottoms are
formed according to centers and measurements of time from a center , base or beginning point ,
either top or bottom . The angles formed going straight up and across , ‘may a com’ just the
same going across as the stock travels over for days,weeks,months or years . Thus , a stock
going up to 22.5 would strike an angle of 22.5 * . If it moves over 22.5 days it would strike the
angle or 22.5 weeks or 22.5 months , it would also strike an angle of 22.5 * , and the higher it is
when those angles are struck and the angle it hits going up , the greater the resistance to be
met. Reverse that rule going down .
Market movements are made just the same as any other thing which is constructed . It is just the
same as constructing a building . First the foundation has to be laid down and then the four walls
have to be completed and last , but not least of all , the top has to be put on . The cube or
hexagon proves exactly the law which works because of time and space in the market . When a
building is put up it is built according to a square or hexagon. It has four walls or four sides , a
bottom and a top ; therefore , it is a cube .
In working out the 20- year Cycle in the stock market , the first 60* or 5 years , from the
beginning forms the bottom of the cube . The second 60* , running to 120* , completes the first
angle or the first side and runs out the 10 year Cycle . The third 60 * or the second side , ends
15 years or 180 *. It is very important because we have the building half completed and must
meet the strongest resistance at this point . The fourth 60 * , or at the end of 20 yrs or 240
months , completes the third side . We are now two thirds around the building , a very strong
point which culminates and completes our 20 – year Cycle . The fifth 60 * , or 300 * point ,days
,weeks , or months completes 25 years , a repetition of the first five years , but it completes the
fourth side of our building and is a very important angle . The sixth 60 * , or 360 * , completing
the circle and ending 30 years as measured by our Time Factor , which runs 1* per month on an
angle of 45 * , completes the top .This is a complete cube and we begin over again . "
"Study this in connection with the Hexagon Chart . It will help you . "

Understanding Gann Price and Time Cycle 
http://www.brameshtechanalysis.com/2015/03/understanding-gann-price-and-time-cycle/ 
365 days is an important cycle of one year. In a circle there are 360 degrees which very nearly correspond 
to this cycle. In other words, one day is equal to one degree of the circle that the earth makes around the 
sun. Hence the significance of the important divisions of the circle (into angles) on the chart. These angles 
are 45, 90, 120, 135, 180, 225, 240, 270, 315 and 360. 
Dividing a line parallel to the 90 degree division of the circle we get a square. Divisions of this square gives 
important angles on the charts. 
There are two kinds of cycles: 
 
Time cycle or natural cycles and 
 
Cycles derived from the significant prices. 
And these cycles will have important divisions on 1/8, 1/4, 1/3, 3/8, 1/2, 5/8, 2/3, 3/4 and 7/8. Thus the 30 
year time cycle will be divided into important probable turning points as follows: 
1/8 – 3.75 years 
1/4 – 7.5 years 
1/3 – 10 years and so on. 
The significant time cycle/squares are Square of 52 on weekly charts. 
Use it on important high/low as well as on those points which start a 90 day cycle. Also two squares or a 
cycle of two years can be used. Inner squares (squares formed within the square) and outer squares 
(squares of the same size placed adjacent or diagonal to the square) should also be seen when price moves 
into the same. Square of 90 is also important – in the same manner as square of 52 on weekly charts and 
monthly charts. 
Square of 144 is the most important square for use on monthly charts. These cycles have influence on price 
in terms of absolute numbers in addition to the time cycles they signify. It means that a movement of 144 
point in a stock is important by itself. 
  
Weekly and monthly time cycles are the most important cycles. 
The cycles derived from prices are based on High, Low and Range (i.e. difference between high and low). 
The most powerful is the square of the range. The absolute number at high, low or that of range is 
assumed to be forming a time cycle with so many days, weeks or months. In other words, a high at 
60 means a time cycle of 60 days/weeks/months. 
For the below points visualize using gann box it will be easy to understand. 
Thus a cycle derived from prices will have two axis – Vertical price axis and horizontal time axis. Significant 
changes can be expected at important divisions of price or time. But the most significant changes should be 
expected at the angles made by combining the two. These angles are made on the square of the price. Here 
square does not mean price raised to the power of two. This is the geometrical square where the length of 
one side is equal to the price. The square is drawn down from high and up from low. The square of range 
can be made down from top or up from low. In a square of high at say 60, drawn on daily graph will have its 
corners at the following four points – 1) at the price (at 60) 2) at the price (at 60) 60 days away in future i.e. 
60 on price axis 60 days to the right on the time axis from the day on which the price has reached 60. 3) at 
zero on price axis just below the high and 4) at zero 60 days to the right of point 3. 
If the price moves down one point each day the price will reach to the point 4, i.e. 0 on the 60th day. This 
action is called squaring off of the price. The angle of fall will be 45% on the square. This is also referred 
to as 1×1 angle i.e. fall of one unit in one day. In same fashion we can draw angle 2×1 i.e. fall of two units in 
one day and so on. The most significant angles are 2×1, 1×1 and 1×2. These angles are drawn from point 1, 
3 and the mid-point between 1 and 3 and the mid-point on 2 and 4. 
Crossing over of the angles drawn on the square are considered probable turning points. Angles 
from 50% mark should always be seen.
```

### Page 2

```
When the price breaks below 45% angle line it signifies a weak position and indicates a decline to the next 
angle. If it again crosses the 45% angle it is said to have regained its strength. At the crossover of these 
angles distance from the base i.e. the day of high/ low is important. Larger the distance, more powerful the 
trend is likely to be. 
1/2 is the most important level. This is the centre of gravity. If the price falls below this level and bounces 
back to touch this level again, on the first such occasion it is good set up to shortsell. If the price 
comes to 50% of high and 50% in time, it may be a high probability buy which may result in 3 
months fast move up on the weekly chart. 
The third time against any support or resistance zone is the dangerous time. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 9th 
and 12th squares are the significant squares of lows but all should be monitored. (i.e. the price levels at 
2,3,4,7,9,12 times the low). 
Gann trend following techniques 
http://www.brameshtechanalysis.com/2015/01/gann-trend-following-techniques/ 
 Trend and trend following techniques: In fast advancing markets, in the last stage of the campaign, 
reactions get smaller as stocks work to higher level, until the final run has ended. Then comes a sharp 
reaction and a reversal in the trend. Same happens in the bear market. Once you are convinced that a trend 
is in force, do not wait too long to go with the trade. Early in the trend buy/sell a stock which is already 
strong/weak. 
 
Fast moves generally come from bear market bottoms. 
 
These moves usually run three weeks up, then move sideways three to five more weeks, and then 
accelerate followed by another sideways movement. 
 
Under fast moves the first signal to trend change is overbalance i.e. reaction gets larger compared to 
the earlier ones, specially in the fifth wave. Watch the changes in momentum of price – is the 
market/stock gaining less points in more time? If the market is trending up, then it should go up more 
time than it goes down. And vice versa. 
Any reversal pattern should be seen in conjunction with the time cycles. Do not pay attention to the 
financial press. 
Use simple trading filter of not entering the market on the third day of the move. 
The Cycle of years : Seasonality 
Watch for significant days in solar year – Dec. 22, March 21, June 22, Sep 21/23 etc. and days on 
important angles from these days e.g. 15 days from Dec. 22 i.e. Jan 5-6, Feb 5, May 6, July 7, August 8 etc. 
Important count of days: Significant changes in trend may take place on the following days from the 
significant highs/ lows – 30, 45, 60, 90, 135, 150, 180, 210, 225, 315, 330 and 360. 
These are calendar day counts: Trading day counts are 11, 22, 33, 45, 56, 67, 78, 90, 101, 112, 123, 135, 
146, 157, 168 and 180. True understanding of cycles are obtained from the calendar days. 
Important count of weeks: 13, 26, 39, 45, 52, 78.   7 week period is considered as death zone. 
Important count of months – 6, 12, 144. 
  
In the short term, watch 3.5 day i.e. the 3rd / 4th day from the important top / bottom for change in 
minor trend. It may become a beginning of a major trend. 
Reactions will often last for two or three weeks. Therefore watch 14th day and 21st day along with the 7th 
day from the important top/ bottom. Out of these 14th is the most significant and 21 the next. (Note that 14 is 
very close to 13 and 21 is Fibonacci number itself). 
1/16 of the year is 23 days. Watch for this too. 
Square of 7, 49 is very important for change in trend. 
Watch for a change after 42 days (2×21), but the change may not occur until 45th-46th day. (I have noticed 
that on many charts of A group stocks 42 day or near about fixed time cycles are important. These numbers, 
very close to each other, gives some flexibility in analysis, Fibonacci numbers plus minus a few days). 
On yearly charts, 90 year, 60 year, 30 year, 20 year, 10 year, 7 years and their multiples and 5 year cycles 
are important to watch especially the simultaneous end/ beginning of these cycles. 
1/3 years from any top/bottom when combines with 1/2 or 1/4 years from any other top/bottom becomes 
very important. 1/2 of the year is the very important – same as the half of the range/high. Anniversaries, 
however are the most important. 39 weeks and 17 weeks and 35 weeks are also important.

Techniques in Market Timing - Price Time Squaring  
https://www.amazingaccuracy.com/investing-article-detail.php?artID=69 
In this article I will discuss a technical analysis technique used for forecasting a change in market trend 
called Price/Time Squaring. It is a technique that many associate with the late great W. D. Gann. 
The idea here is to start from a major market top or bottom price and to calculate its 'square'. At first 
glance you might think this means to simply square the price by multiplying it with itself. Close, but not 
exactly. 
First, to solve for the 'time' itself, you would actually take the 'square root' of the starting price. Take for 
example the weekly chart of Soybeans. Week of December 5, 2008 put in a major market bottom. 
Using the low of that week (my charts are reverse-adjusted, so your price may differ somewhat) at 626, 
you take the square root to arrive at 25.02. Because the result is just above 25, it is now inside the 26th 
square. To understand this, think of the first square to be from 0 to .99. The second square would then 
begin at 1 to 1.99, etc. 
Starting from the December 5, 2008 weekly price bar as bar zero, you start to count 26 price bars to the 
right. We arrive at June 5, 2009, which turned out to be one weekly price bar from the major top of 
week June 12, 2009. In the world of market timing, getting to within a single price bar of a major market 
trend change is quite the edge to have. 
Another misconception that some have is that when you are calculating for Price/Time that when 'time' 
arrives the 'price' would be at exactly square of the original price. In reality, however, while this may 
occur at times it is not what should be expected. Rather, when 'time' nears the trader should then be 
looking at price to reach one of the 'square' levels for which there will be more than one.

Price and Time Decision Points the W. D. Gann Way 
W. D. Gann was an incredible chartist and trader back in the early part of the 20th Century. One of the 
most powerful technical analysis methods he shared in the works he left behind was the application of 
'percentage movements'. 
Gann believed (and has demonstrated) that important price levels could be determined by dividing 
ranges by 8 as well as 3. He then pointed out that these divisional price points had different levels of 
importance. 
For example, dividing a range by 8 you would end up with percentage levels of 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50, 62.5, 
75 and 87.5. And of course there is 100%, although focus is on the divisions of the complete 100% 
range. 
First level of importance is generally considered the 50% level. After that would be 33.3 and 66.66 
(thirds). 
These levels could be determined on a market that is correcting (moving back within the price range 
the divisions are derived from) in order to try and determine price levels that might stop the correction, 
or they could be added to the end of the price range to determine levels of extension (beyond the 
range). 
For the first example, say price moves up from a bottom at 100 and stops at 200, then starts down 
again. The range equals 100 points, so the support levels would be 200 (the top of the range) minus 
12.5 (187.50), 25 (175), 37.5 (162.5) and so-forth. 
For the second example using the same range as the previous example, the extended price levels 
would be 200 (again the top of the range) plus 12.5 (212.5), 25 (225)...50 (250) and so-forth. And of 
course you would do the same with the levels calculated from thirds. 
These levels act as price decision points, where the technical analyst and trader would then have to 
further determine if price is likely to make bottom or top at that level. While price often forms bottoms 
and tops at one of these levels, knowing which one requires more than just noticing a pause in price 
action at that level. 
Thus, W. D. Gann also expressed how these percentage calculations can be applied to TIME. For 
example, if the range from 100 to 200 took 28 days to complete, that gives a range in TIME as well. 
With your range in time, best divided in quarters (25, 50, 75, 100) and thirds (33.33, 66.66) and the 
result added to the last day of that range, you get points in time where you would look to see if price is 
also at one of the support or resistance levels you calculated from price. 
This is just one of the many valuable methods taught by W. D. Gann that every technical trader should 
know and put into practice.

Study of Gann concept and the implementations 
http://studyofgann.blogspot.in/2008/09/time-and-price.html 
Time and Price 
By Howard Arrington 
 
William D. Gann (1878-1955) was a legendary trader who designed several unique techniques for analyzing price 
charts. He developed a unique combination of precise mathematical and geometric principles which are not easy 
to grasp. Gann analysts have spent years pouring over old charts and writings in search of Gann’s secret, and 
there is no end to the number of people who claim to have discovered Gann’s insight and technique that has 
eluded everyone else. Perhaps someone has discovered it. I am not in a position to appraise all the claims 
because I am not a Gann expert and have not read Gann’s writings. 
 
Don Hall has published a book and developed a system called Pyrapoint which seems to me to be well founded 
in Gann principles. The purpose of this article is to take one idea used in Don’s work, and present it from a 
different approach, and yet arrive at the same useful conclusion. I hope even Don will fi nd my article to be an 
original insight to substantiate the validity of his work. 
 
Gann’s geometric angles are trend lines drawn from prominent tops or bottoms at certain angles. The most 
important angle is 45 degrees, which means the line’s slope is one unit of price per unit of time. (Note: Depending 
of the chart scale used, the line may or may not appear to be plotted at a 45 degree angle.) For years, I thought 
this is what Gann analysts meant by the phrase ‘squaring time and price.’ However, Don’s Pyrapoint method gave 
me a new insight, which is: 
Price = Time squared or P = t ^ 2 
 
Let me take this mathematical relationship and develop it in this article. The above relationship between price and 
time can be plotted on a chart as shown in this illustration. The time values of 10, 20, and 30 are marked by the 
three arrows. See Figure 1. 
 
 
 
For the sake of illustration, let’s suppose a prominent top or bottom occurs at a price of 400. The theory is that 
this signifi cant point has a mathematical counterpart. Start a new time curve at this point in time, and it will give 
us an expectation for a future top or bottom to occur on this curve. This principle can be stated as ‘When price 
meets time, a change is imminent.’ This ‘price meets time’ relationship is shown in the following chart. See Figure
```

### Page 6

```
2. 
 
 
With the prominent top or bottom at P, if price meets the curve at point A it will do so in 18 bars. The time to A is 
the square root of the price at A. Price at A is 324. Square root of 324 is 18. 
 
If price meets the curve at point B, it will do so in 20 bars. The time to B is the square root of the price at B. Price 
at B is 400, therefore the time to B is 20 bars. 
 
If price meets the curve at point C, it will do so in 22 bars. This is a very interesting concept! 
 
Remember that price and time are related by the formula: 
P = t ^ 2 or t = sqrt( P ) 
 
In this article, I will develop the mathematics for the slope of a trend line using the price and time relationship 
presented in the previous article. Let’s work with the model illustrated in this See Figure 3. 
 
 
 
From the previous article, the next time curve will be t bars away for a given price P. At a time t+1 price would 
meet the curve at price P1. Now, lets solve for the slope of the trend line shown in blue which connects P and P1. 
 
P = t ^ 2 
 
P1 = (t + 1) ^ 2 = t ^ 2 + 2 t + 1 = P + 2 t + 1 
 
Slope = (Change in price) / (Change in time) 
 
Change in price = P1 - P = P + 2 t + 1 - P = 2 t + 1 = 2 t + 2 - 1 = 2 [ t + 1] -1 
 
Change in time = t + 1 
 
Therefore, slope of P to P1 is = (2 [ t + 1] - 1) / (t+1) = 2 – 1 / (t+1) = 2 - 1 / sqrt( P1 ) 
 
If we normalize all prices to consider three signifi cant digits, then all prices will fall in the range 
of [100 ... 1000]. By substituting the price boundaries into the slope formula, 
we can get a range of slopes as follows.
```

### Page 7

```
For a P1 of 100, the slope of the up trend line to 100 = 2 - 1 / 10 = 1.9 
For a P1 of 1000, the slope of the up trend line to 1000 = 2 - 1 / 100 = 1.99 
The slope of the up trend line at the midpoint of this price range is 2 - 1 / sqrt(500) = 1.96 
 
Let’s call this trend line a 45 degree line because we developed the slope using one unit of price change from P 
to P1 with one unit of time t. For this 45 degree line, the slope is basically 2. I 
think this is strong justifi cation as to why Gann used 2 cents as the price grid interval of his daily grain charts. 
Such a scale layout would naturally give Gann 45 degree angles with a slope of 2 cents per daily bar. I have 
shown that 2 is the slope of the upward 45 degree trend 
line that develops from the price and time relationship given by the formula: P = t ^ 2. 
 
One can solve for the slope of the downward trend line from P1 to P to obtain this result: 
 
Slope of P1 to P = (-2 t - 1) / (t-1) = (-2 [t - 1] - 3 ) / (t-1) = -2 - 3 / (t-1) = -2 – 3 / (sqrt( P ) - 1) 
 
For a P of 100, the slope of the down trend line to 100 = -2 - 3/9 = -2.33 
 
For a P of 1000, the slope of the down trend line to 1000 = -2 - 3/99 = -2.03 
 
Again, the slope of the down trend line approaches a value of -2. Therefore, -2 is a good approximation for the 
slope of a downward 45 degree trend line. 
 
Now I would not bother to give you the mathematics in the previous two articles if I did not fi nd application of this 
theory in the charts. I used the mathematics given in the fi rst two articles to 
develop a tool in ESPL which draws horizontal lines at calculated price levels, and nearly vertical time curves at 
the calculated time intervals. This forms a grid of trapezoids like the previous illustration. (Don Hall calls them 
‘squares’.) 
 
Diagonal lines connect the corners of the trapezoids to give support and resistance trend lines. 
Here is a daily chart of JNPR with the construction started on the highest high. All price levels, time intervals, and 
trend lines are constructed mathematically from two pieces of information: the price $244.50 on the date 10-16-
2000. 
 
There is more in this chart than I have space to explain. But, I can point out some haracteristics. The horizontal 
price lines have a label on the left which is a degree of rotation around a Square of 9. This is covered in the 
Pyrapoint book, but is beyond the scope of this article. Note that in my example, the time lines are nearly vertical. 
This is a slight variation from the method of construction in the Pyrapoint book which shows vertical lines. I feel 
that my presentation is appropriate because of the theory of the time curve illustrated in my fi rst article. The time 
curve forms the left and right sides of the trapezoid, and the price levels form the top and bottom sides.
```

### Page 8

```
Time: Time is measured by the time curve, which is related to price. 
Tip: ‘As price meets time, a change is imminent.’ 
Note the first time line labeled 12 on the bottom and 16 on the top. 
If price meets time at the -720 horizontal, then the time for the change would be the 12th bar from the top. 
If price meets time at the -540 horizontal, then the time for the change would be the 13th bar from the top. At the -
360 horizontal, the time change would be in the 14th bar. At the -180 horizontal, the time change would be in the 
15th bar. At the 0 line, the time measured would be 16 bars. 
 
That is why the top of the time line is labeled with a 16, and the bottom of the line is labeled with a 12. Starting at 
16, for each 180 degree down the time count is reduced by one bar, or for every 180 degree rise, the time count 
increases another bar. Note that the market did experience a change when price met the time curve labeled 12 to 
16! 
 
The price at the 12 to 16 time line was used to obtain a forecast of the 2nd time line, which is labeled 25 to 31. As 
the price meets each time curve, a new time curve is calculated based on the price. Each of the time curves 
shows excellent correlation with market change when price met the time line. 
 
Prices: The prominent high of $24.50 is the calculation basis for all the horizontal price levels that are shown. 
 
Tip: The market seeks out these price levels, and you can calculate these prices in advance. Note how the 
market fell to the -540 horizontal, rallied to the -180 horizontal, fell to the -900 level, rallied to the -540 level, fell to 
the -1080 level, and rallied to the -720 level. 
 
Trend Lines: The downward 45 degree trend lines shown in red create a flow channel, or ‘price highway’ as Don 
calls it. 
The upward 45 degree trend lines shown in green create a price highway going the other direction. 
The red lines are resistance lines that the market must close above to change direction from bearish to bullish. 
The green lines are support lines that the market must close below to change direction from bullish to bearish. 
 
We all have used upward trend lines placed underneath action lows to indicate support, and downward trend lines 
placed above action highs to indicate resistance. The beauty of this tool is that these diagonal trend lines are 
computed in advance, and the market seems to have respect for them. Price fl ows up and down the channels. 
The more you study the example, the more impressed I think you will be with this tool. 
 
The Pyrapoint tool can also be applied to intra-day charts with good success. The size of the price interval used 
on a daily chart seems to be too big for use on an intra-day chart. No problem. Don points out that there are 
squares within a square. All one needs to do is subdivided the price interval into halves, fourths, or eighths. The 
time interval is determined from price and will not change. 
 
One question that I have dealt with is this: If the time interval computes to be 11 bars because the price is at 121, 
which intra-day bar time frame should I use? If 1-minute bars are used, then we have a time curve 11 minutes 
later. If 2-minute bars are used, then the time curve would be 22 minutes later. If 5-minute bars are used, then the 
time curve is plotted 55 minutes later. Now do you see why I have a question? The selection of the intra-day bar 
time frame greatly affects the time interval measured by the next time curve. 
 
Here is how I tackled the problem, and the proposed solution. I displayed a 1-minute chart and used a cycle tool 
to measure in hindsight the cycle rhythm from bottoms to bottoms, tops to tops, 
and/or bottoms to tops. When I found a cycle width that seems to fi t by catching multiple turning points, I note the 
number of minutes in the cycle. I use this formula to estimate a good intra-day time frame to use. 
 
Intra-day Bar Time Frame = Cycle width in minutes / sqrt( P ) 
Example: On the JNPR 1-minute chart I found a 65 minute cycle when the price was around $133. Therefore, bar 
time = 65 / sqrt( 133 ) = 5.6 minutes per bar. So, using a 6-minute chart, or 
possibly a 5-minute chart should show a good fi t with the Pyrapoint tool. I happened 
to have been following a 5-minute chart, and I do fi nd excellent correlation. 
I have used a smaller price interval by subdividing the 180 degree interval into 
eighths in this example. See Figure 5.

Please study the chart, and observe the fl ow of prices in the up and down trend channels. Note how trend 
changes occur on or near the vertical time curves, and how the market seeks the horizontal price levels. This 
entire road map is computed in advance from the prominent 
top that occurred on January 12th at 9:35 a.m.

W.D. Gann MATHEMATICAL FORMULA FOR MARKET PREDICTIONS
THE MASTER MATHEMATICAL PRICE 
TIME AND TREND CALCULATION
This chart is made on transparent plastic so that you can place it over 
daily, weekly, or monthly high or low chart and see at a glance the position on the 
time and place based on the geometrical angles. It is designed to give QUICK 
ACCURATE EASY CALCULATIONS: SAVE TIME AND PREVENT ERRORS.
The square of 12 is always important in working out time periods because 
there are 12 month in a year. The square of 144 is the GREAT SQUARE and 
works  better  than  any  others  square  both  for  TIME  AND  PRICE  because  it 
contains all of the squares from 1 to 144. This chart is divided up into sections of 
9 both for time and price because 9 is the highest digit. Nine spaces on the daily 
chart equals 9 days, 9 weeks or 9 month in time periods and 9 equals 9c on 
grains, 9 points on stocks or 90 points on cotton on the daily high and low chart.
One column in the square of 144 contains 144. This would equal $144 on 
grain, 144 points on stocks or using a scale of 10 points to 1/8 inch it will equal 
1140 points on cotton.
MASTER 144 SQUARE CONTAINS 324 square inched and each square inch 
contains 64 units which gives 20,736. This is 20,736 weeks or months and the 
proportionate  parts  of  this  are  used  for  the  measurement  of  time  and  price 
because this is the great cycle.
THE GREAT CYCLE OF THE SQUARE OF 144.
The time period of this square is 20,736 days, weeks or months. One- 
half(1/2) is 10,368 days. One-fourth(1/4) is 5,184 days. One-eighth(1/8) is 2,592 
days. One-sixteenth(1/16) is 1,296 days. One-thirty-second(1/32) is 648 days 
and the one-sixty-four(1/64) is 324 calendar or market days. 1/128 is 162 days 
and 1/256 is 81 days or the square of 9.
WEEKLY TIME PERIODS.
THE GREAT CYCLE in weeks is 2962 and 2 days and 1/2 of this period is 
1481 weeks and 1 day. One-fourth is 740 weeks. One-eighth 370 weeks and 2
days, One-sixteenth is 185 weeks, 1 day. One-thirty-second is 92 weeks, 4 
days and 1/64 is 41 weeks, 2 days.
MONTHLY TIME PERIODS.
THE GREAT CYCLE in month is 681 months and 23 days. One-half of this 
is 28 years, 9 months and 23 days. One-fourth is 14 years, 5 month and 8 days. 
One-eighth is 7 years, 2 1/2 months. One-sixteenth is 43 months and days. The 
weekly  and  monthly  time  periods  from  major  high  and low  and  be  checked 
determine the future trend.
THE MASTER NUMBERS:
The Master Numbers are 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12. The No. 9 and its multiple is the 
most important because 9 digits added together equal 45. The next number of 
greatest importance is 7, the number mentioned more times in the Bible than any 
other number. There are 7 days in the week and 7 calendar days as well as 5 
market days, and their multiples should be carried on your Daily, Weekly and

Monthly Charts. The square of 7 is 49, which is a very important time period. The 
2nd square of 7 is 98 and the third square of 7 is 147 and the fourth square of 7 
is 196 and 196 is also the square of 14. The next number in importance is No. 5 
which is the balancing number between 1 and 9. The square of 5 is 25 and the 
second square of 5 is 50 which is just I over the square of 7 making 49 to 50 very 
important for a change in trend. There squares of 5 is 75 and 5 squares of 5 is 
100 and 100 is the square of 10, which is also important for changes.
The No. 3 is mentioned in the Bible next to the No. 7 and 3 is important 
because 3 x 3 equals 9, the square of 3, and it is the first old number that forms 
a square greatest that itself. Three must be used in every way possible, 3 x 7 
equals 21, 3 x 5 equals 15, 3 x 9 equals 27 and 3 x 12 equals 36, very important 
because it is the square of 6. The No. 12 is also spoken of in the Bible many times 
and is of great importance. Jesus selected 12 disciples. There are 12 month in the 
year, and 12 signs of the Zodiac. The important 12's in the square of 144 are 12, 
24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132 and 144. These are all important for 
both time and price in days, weeks and months.
Referring to the No. 9, 7 x 9 is 63 and is of great importance because the 
square of 8 is 64, therefore, around 63 to 64 is very important to watch the 
change in trend.  7 x 12 is 84 and this is of very great importance and the 
number next to this is 90, which is 10 x 9 and 90 is 1/4 of the circle, which is 
very important for time and price changes. Next in importance is 9 x 12 which is 
108 of 3/4 of 144.
The  importance  of  the  circle  of  360  deg.  must  not  be  overlooked  in 
connection with the square of 144 because the proportionate parts of the circle 
agree with the parts of 144. 2 1/2 times 144 equals 360 and 1 1/4 times 144 
equals 180, 1/2 of the circle, and 90 is 5/8 of 144. 9 is 1/16 of 144, 18 is 1/8, 
27 is 3/8, 36 is 1/4, 45 is 5/16 and always very important for time and price 
changes and for resistance levels. 48 is 1/3 of 144 and 54 is 3/8 and 63 is 7/16, 
72 is 1/2 of 144, 81 the square of 9, is 9/16 of 144 and 90 is 5/8, 99 is 11/16, 
108 is 3/4, 117 is 13/16, and 126 is 7/8 and 135 is 15/16 of 144. These are the 
most important in the square of 12 and should be watched closely when time 
periods in days, week or months reach these points on the Master Calculator. 
Remember that you should always watch the Daily Chart for the first indication 
of the change in trend and at the same time look at the position on the Weekly 
Chart on 7 days time periods which is next in importance. The Monthly Chart is 
of the greatest importance for changes in the main trend.
THE IMPORTANCE OF 3 AND 5.
The movement in PRICE and TIME whether on a Daily, Weekly or Monthly 
chart has three important points, the PRICE, the TIME AND VOLUME of sales, 
the PITCH or TREND which is the geometrical angle which show whether time is 
influencing and driving prices up or down on slow angle or an acute fast moving 
angle.  There  are  also  four  factors  that  influence  prices,  PRICE,  TIME  AND 
VOLUME AND VELOCITY. Time is the most important factor because when time 
is up volume increases and the velocity of speed of the market increases and the 
PITCH or TREND on the angles moves up faster or down faster.
There are three other important points to consider on a Daily, Weekly or 
Monthly High and Low Chart. There are LOW PRICE, the HIGHEST PRICE and 
the RANGE 1/2 between the high and low.
```

### Page 3

```
FIVE FACTORS FOR TIME AND PRICE
There are high, low, halfway point, opening and closing prices. The trend is 
indicated by closing price, especially when the market very active. If the prices 
closes above the half way point or near the high, the trend is up. If it closes below 
the half way point or near the low, the selling is greater than the buying and the 
trend is down, at list temporarily. In connection with the Master Time and Trend 
Calculator apply all of the rules with the Master Time Factor and geometric 
angles.
STRONGEST POINT FOR TIME AND PRICE RESISTANCE.
In using the Master Square of 144, the strongest points are 1/4, 1/3, 2/3, 
3/8, 1/2, 5/8, 3/4, 7/8 and the complete square of 144.
The points where the most angle cross are the strongest for resistance in 
PRICE and TIME.
TRIAGLE POINTS.
The triagle points or where the green angles cross the most important: 
These are 72, 144, 36, 48, 96, 108 and of couse 72, and at the end of the square 
144 at the tom and the bottom.
SQUARES IN THE SQUARE OF 144.
These squares where the angles cross are of great importance for time and 
price resistance. These are 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 90, 108, and the top and the 
bottom. When the price is at a point equal 36 and the time period in days, weeks 
or month is at 36, TIME and PRICE SQUARE and it is important to watch for 
change in trend. With the square of 144 you can get any square from 1 to 144. 
Suppose you want to get the square of 72: you move across to 72 for time and if 
price is at 72 moving up on the chart, PRICE and TIME have balanced, or square 
out, and we at the 45 degree angle and at the half way point the Master Price, 
Time and Trend Calculator.
WHERE TO WATCH FOR CHANGE IN TREND
Most changes in trend occur when the TIME PERIODS are at one-half of 
the square of 144 and at the end of square or at the 1/3, 2/3, 1/4, and 3/4 
points in the square of 144; you must always watch the square in time of the 
HIGHEST PRICE and the MINOR HIGHS and LOWS, also the square of time of 
the LOWEST PRICE and the SECOND OR THIRD higher bottom, and also the 
time required to square the Range and where this square works out of Master 
Square of 144.
EXAMPLE: The lowest price that wheat ever sold was 28c per bushel, In 
March 1852, therefore every 28 month would square the lowest price. The highest 
price that wheat over sold was in May 11, 1917 when the May Option sold at 
325, therefore it would require 325 month to square the highest price. The lowest 
price that the May option ever sold was 44c, therefore it would require 44 
month in time to square the low price. The range between 44 and 325 is 281c 
which would require 281 months, 281 weeks or 281 days to square the range. You 
would look on the Master Chart and see that 2 squares of 144 equals 288, 
therefore, you would watch for change in trend between 281 and 288 or near 
the end of the second square of 144. 7 x 44, the extreme low, equals 308, 
therefore, 6 1/2 times 44 would equal 286, which is within two points of the end 
of the square of 144 or
```

### Page 4

```
the end   of the second square making 286 an important time period to watch for 
a change in trend. In squaring the range 325, the highest price for May wheat 
would be 2 squares of 144 and 17 over, therefore, when the time reached 36 
days, weeks or months in the Master Square of 144 you can see that resistance 
would be met because moving up the time period of 136 you can see that the 45 
deg. angle moving down from 72, which is the INNER SQUARE and the line 
drawn across from 36 on the price scale crosses at 36. In this way you can see 
that  the  Master  Chart  would  indicate  a  resistance  in  time  and  price 
corresponding with the square of the highest price, the lowest price, and the 
Range. All other time periods from a high price, low price, or the range of any 
commodity or of the stock should be worked out in this same way.
You will succeed in using the Master Mathematical Price, Time and Trend 
Calculator by going over the charts and laying the calculator over them and 
working out past history. In this way you will learn just how it works and prove to 
yourself the great value of the Master Calculator.
HOURLY TIME PERIODS
When Markets are very active and making a wide range in price, it is 
important to keep an hourly High and Low Chart will give the first change in 
trend.
There are 24 hours in a day, therefore, 6 days are required to pass throught 
144 and a total of 864 days to pass the square of 144.
At  the  present  time,  all  exchanges  are  open  5  days  a  week  with  the 
exception of holidays and most of them are open 5 hours each day, therefore, it 
will require 28 days and 4 hours to pass throughtt 144 and the rate of 5 hours 
per day and 5 days per week.
GREAT YEARLY TIME CYCLE:
To pass throughtt the square of 144, which equals 20,736, it requires 56 
years,  9  months  and  23  days,  which  is  very  important  time  cycle.  Next  in 
importance is 1/2 of this time period which is 28 years, 5 months and 8 days and 
1/4 which is 14 years, 2 months and 19 days. The 14 year cycle is always very 
important because it is 2 seven year periods. 14 years equal 168 months and 169 
months is the square of 13 making it very important for a change in trend and 
this is also an important time resistance point.
1/8 of the Great Cycle is 7 years, 1 month and 10 days and is quite 
important. 1/16 is 42 months and 20 days, 1/32 is 32 months and 30 days. This 
is an important time period because is is close to 22 1/2 months which is 1/16 of 
the circle of 360 degrees.
NINE SPACES AND NINE TIME PERIODS:
The chart being divided up into 9 sections gives all the squares of 9 for 
price resistance of time resistance which, as referred to above is 9c on the Daily 
Chart for grains and the same for Weekly and Monthly Charts: that is, 1c to each 
1/8  inch.  For  different  commodities,  different  scales  are  used.  (See  Special 
Instructions for the different commodities.)
The Chart being divided up into 9 sections gives a 16 the squares of 9 for 
rpice resistance or time resistance which, as referred to above, is 90 points of the
```

### Page 5

```
Daily Chart, 135 on the Weekly Chart, and 270 on the Monthly and 2880 on the 
20 points scale and 9 spaces equal 180 points.
The angles in red are all drawn on the squares of 9. The Inner Square of 
450 is drawn from 72 because 72 is 1/2 of 144. These angles come out at 72, 144
and 72.
The straight lines are in green and are 1/3 of the square of 144 in 
price or
time.
GREEN ANGLES:
The green angles are the angles of 2 x 1 which up two spaces of 2 points in 
one period of the time. The other angle below the 450 angle is the angle of 1 x 2 
which requires 2 time periods to move up 1 space or 1c per bushel on grains for 
each time period of 1 day, week or 1 month. These angles move down from the 
top at the rate of 2 points or 2 spaces per time periods or at the rate of 1/2 space, 
1/2 point or 1/2c per time period. The distance that the green angles and the red 
angles are apart determines how far prices can advance or decline.
When the market enters the INNER SQUARE it is important for a change in 
trend and time angles and Position in the square tell at the time it entered 
whether the price is going up or down. Also when price breaks below a 45° on the 
INNER SQUARE it show weakness in proportion to the time from high or low 
price.
WHEN TO START A NEW SQUARE:
When the time period of the Daily, Weekly or Monthly Charts has moved 
144 you begin a new square. But to get the position you simply move the Master 
Square over to 144 and place it over the chart to get the position in the next 
square.
STRONGEST AND WEAKEST POINTS:
Where the greatest number of angles cross or bisect each other in the 
square of 144 are the points of greatest resistance, such as where the 25 and 2 x 
1 angles cross each other.
Study and practice on past action of the market and you will soon learn 
how to determine the trend very quickly by using the Master Chart.
HOW TO USE  THE MASTER SQUARE OF 144:
Follow all rules on angles as given in the Master Forecasting course.
Place this chart at the bottom or 0 on the Daily, Weekly or Monthly Chart 
or place the bottom of the chart on the low price or SQUARE of the HIGH PRICE. 
The LOW PRICE, and the square of the RANGE and show where time and price 
balances.
When you figure the halfway point of the extreme high or the halfway point 
of the range, place either the top or the bottom of the chart on the halfway point 
and it will give the correct POSITION and TREND. However, if you will place the 
CENTER, or 72, on the halfway point in PRICE you will then geg(get?) the correct 
position in time and can see how the price is working out with time in the

MASTER SQUARE of 144 and the INNER SQUARE which starts from 72, the 
gravity center of 1/2 point of the square.
CALENDAR DAYS AND MARKET DAYS:
For any kind of a chart, we move over one space for each unit of time. 
Therefore, it would require 155 market days or 144 calendar days to complete the 
square of 144. When prices pass out of one square into another, a change in 
trend  usually  takes  place  and  the  periods  and  geometrical  angles  on  this 
MASTER CHART tell you which way the trend is going to change.
LEAP YEARS:
In calculating time periods to get exact number of days and weeks the LEAP 
YEAR must be figured and one extra day added. From 1864 the Leap Years were 
as  follows:  1868,  1872;  1876;  1880;  1884;  1888;  1892;  1896;  (added  my

POSITION WITH MASTER SQUARE.
To get the position with the MASTER SQUARE of 144 day it over the Daily, 
Weekly or Monthly and start from extreme low, extreme high, 0 or 1/2 point of 
the range of 1/2 of the high selling place. You can also place the top of the chart 
at the high selling price. In this way you can get the correct time and positions or 
angles at a glance.
Place MASTER CALCULATOR on January to get twelve year periods, each 
month same way.
You should have all time periods from important highs and lows calculated 
in days, weeks and months in order that you can took them up quickly on the
MASTER CHART.
Will all time periods brought up to date in this way, you can get the 
position on the MASTER CHART and the indicated trend without looking at a 
daily, weekly or month chart. You should have the time periods in months from 
every important top and bottom.
With the MASTER SQUARE of 144, you work will be cut down but you 
must learn to practice and bring up all time periods and study the MASTER 
SQUARE and learn how to use it to get tops and bottoms accurately. Work and 
practice will bring PRECISION and PROFITS. I have done my part. It is now up to 
you to work hard and if you do, your success is assured.
HOW TO PLACE THE MASTER CHART 
SQUARE OF 144 ON CHARTS
To get correct positions on any of your charts, daily, weekly or monthly, you 
must place the MASTER CHART OVER THEM correctly. The top of the MASTER 
CHART has Price and Time Chart by W. D. Gann on it. Always place this on the 
bottom of your chart unless it is where you move up to a higher price when you 
place it at 72 or bottom market “Bottom” 0.
```

### Page 7

```
Place the MASTER CHART at 0 on any of your other charts or at a Low 
point on the same date of any high or low point. Place the MASTER CHART at 72 
which is 1/2 of 144 on any one-half point of the price range of 1/2 of the high 
selling price.
Always place the MASTER CALCULATOR on all previous high and lows to 
get changes in trend and price resistance. Never overlook the extreme high and 
low price. Also most important 1/2 of high to low and 1/2 of the highest price 
any commodity or stock ever sold.
TIME PERIODS AND PRICE RESISTANCE
The circle of 360° is most important for time cycle and price resistance. First, we 
divide the circle by 2 and get 180 which is one-half and is most important for time or price 
in days, weeks or months. Next we divide the circle by 3 and get the triangle points of 120, 
240 and 360. Third, we divide the circle by 4 which gives 90, 180, 270, and 360, which are 
the squares and most important.
Divide the circle by 8 which gives 8 periods of 45 degree angles which are 45, 90, 
135, 180, 225, 315, and 360. Next in importance is to divide the circle by 16 which gives 
the angles of 22 1/2 degrees. We divide the circle by 32 and get the angles and time 
period of 11 1/4 degrees and their multiples. Divide the circle by 64 gives 5 5/8 degrees 
and their multiples.
The table below shows each division of 5 5/8 and we run down to 16 in the column 
which equals 90 or 1/4 of the circle and 16 is 1/4 of 64. This arrangement reading across 
gives each of the multiples and the figures between the heavy lines are among the ones 
which are the most important.

The squares from 1 to 10 are important to watch for time and price resistance as 
they are important degrees in the circle. These are: 1 – 4 – 9 – 16 – 25 – 36 – 49 – 64 – 
81
– 100 – 121 – 144 – 169 – 196 – 225 - 256 – 289 – 324 and 361, which is the 
square of
19.
Divide the circle by 6 and we get two resistance and time periods which are not 
contained in the other table. These are 60 and 300.
It is also very important to divide the circle by 12 because there are 12 months in 
the year and this works out accurately for time periods. The following are the degrees not 
shown in the above table: 30 – 150 – 210 – 330.
Divide  the  circle  by  24  which  gives  15  degree  periods  in  longitude  and 
approximately 15 days in time. because there are 24 hours in a day and the earth make 1 
revolution on its axis in 24 hours there periods are quite important. The following are not 
contained in the other table: 15 – 75 – 105 – 165 – 195 – 285 – 345.
Under the table of the 64th Circle reaching across from left to right the 2nd column is 
always 90 degrees from the first. Example: The first is 5 5/8 and 17 in the next column is 
95 5/8 or a gain of 90. Opposite 33 is 185 5/8 which is 90 from 95 5/8, opposite 49 is 275
5/8 or 90 from 185 5/8.
The column 1 under 8 between the heavy lines is 45 and the next one is 135, 225, 
and 315 each 90 degrees apart.
At the bottom of column 1 opposite 16 is 90 and reaching across is 180, 
270, and
360. These figures are all 45 degrees from the figures in column 8 which are 
the most important for time and price resistance.
To realize the value and importance of these degrees in the circle you take the price 
of highs and lows and the time periods, especially in weeks and months and check them 
over and you will see how well they work out to these important degrees.
Remember you must always figure how many points or cents the prices are up from 
the extreme low or minor lows and how many cents it is down from the extreme highs or 
minor highs. Also, how many cents it is above or below the main halfway point or the 
minor halfway points or gravity centers. You will find that the important halfway points form 
close to these natural degrees in the circle.
Example: May Soybeans extreme high 435 3/4, extreme low 67, gives the halfway 
point at 251 7/8. Look in the table and you find the 45th 64th and 253 1/8. This halfway 
point is very close. Next 1/2 of 436 3/4 is 218 3/8 and the 39th 64th is 219 3/8, very close to
```

### Page 9

```
this natural resistance degree. The extreme low of Cash Beans was 44 and the halfway 
point between 44 and 436 3/4 is 240 3/8. 240 is 2/3 of a circle or a triangle point and 241 
7/8 is the 43rd 64th of the circle. 44 the extreme low, was only 1 from 45, the important 
resistance level. 67, the lowest price May futures ever sold, is within 1/2 point of 67 1/2 
which is 12/64 or 3/4 between 0 and 90 and 67 1/2 is halfway between 45 and 90 which 
was the cause of May beens making lows for 5 years between 67-69 which indicated the 
big advance that followed as there were triple bottom between 67-69 in three different 
years.
Next consider the time periods December 28, 1932, was low on May Beans and 
December 28, 1947, was 15 years or 180 months which is 1/2 of circle also 1/2 of the 360 
degrees making this a very important time cycle. May beans reached extreme high on 
January 15, 1948, just 18 days beyond the even 15 year cycle. Check all other time 
periods and time cycles in the same way and you will find how well they work out in the 
circle of 360 degrees.

```
144 Square 
 
I’m new to the group, I will post some information we can share with 
each other, about the master charts, how they interelate, and what they 
are based on.  
 
For instance the 144 square shows and defines every market move, from 
the smallest move to the largest swing, the ratios that dominate all 
market movements are the ones every one is familiar with, sacred geo, 
fib, 144 and its multiples, 144 is based on the 12 months, but more 
importantly, Jupiter’s synodic cycle, and also the 1440 minutes in the 
day, the reason why nobody can use the 144 square is they cannot put it 
in time correctly, Gann told everybody to put it on a major high or 
low, that is the biggest line of bullshit he ever wrote.  
 
All markets, you cannot find the starting point if you cannot fit every 
minute of the day into the square, when you have the repeat of a time 
price configuration at the same minute, then you know the cycle that is 
operating.
```

### Page 2

```
I will post seven different days that the market had its origin in the 
same time price configuration. When you understand what is happening in 
the market the master charts take on new meaning, because they are 
designed to work with each other and they do. Basically, Gann knew the 
market was only a geometric solid rotating in front of you, but he also 
knew our senses would not allow us to "see" it, so he created the 
144 square which puts a multidimensional thing like a market into a 
lattice structure that would define more correctly a two dimensional 
awareness. Smart mofo wasn’t he?  
 
The circle defines market movements, 360 degrees has in itself the key 
to the 144 square, they are incredibly related, once you understand 
what the circle really is, then you understand what the geometric solid 
is that is behind the market movements. All you need is written in 
Gann’s books and courses, it’s just your own mind that probably 
prevents you from full understanding. I write this not for recognition, 
but I know lots of Gann students work hard at this stuff, I assure the 
things he spoke of are true. Rest assured, people with tremendous left 
brain logic, atheists or agnostics will never figure Gann’s methods 
out, you need a tremendous amount of right brain awareness and cold 
logic combined, and a connection with the universal mind is also 
needed. 
 
 
Let’s take a look at time and price and see if we can balance it the 
way old Gann did. The emini today is sitting on a price level that 
was balanced some time ago, around the 1066 level, 1064 today I 
believe it closed near. The time angles are in relation to the price 
are way out of balance. Time is seriously ahead of price at this 
conjunction, the clock time balanced out at 139 at 109 pm and the 
longer term time frame came in at 71.79 time angle, the middle of 
the square, the reciprocal 1 divided by 71.79 equals 139 in time 
balancing the clock time, the price is on a 45 degree price line 
that is now old, meaning that theoretically the market tomorrow 
morning should be off to a price level near 1080 to realign itself 
with the time period, thus bringing the time and price in alignment 
with the forty five degree angle. The true forty five degree angle. 
If the market perhaps blows thru 1080, then it will go to the next 
gravity center of 1086.54, and if hits 1080 and reacts down it 
should settle near the lower gravity center of 1076. Let’s see what 
happens. The old circle of three times itself. I only ask if what I 
say is totally wrong and lame, go easy on me, im here to share with 
you guys !!! gann said that EVERYTHING seeks its gravity center, so 
let put that old dude to the test, shall we ???????????? 
 
Hi you folks 
 
I uploaded a file called time price returns, this shows three days 
exactly so many ............ apart, they are all different days, the 
times and the prices are cut off to prevent reverse enginering, 
notice the similar pattern from the opening each day, follow the 
pattersn and swings, this happened because the first day, the time 
was 49 and the price was 14.25, the harmonic ratio was 2.91, or 
three over the second square of 144,, this means price and time are 
balanced whenever your time price configurations come on the end of 
the square, the next day the time was also at the same ratio but
```

### Page 3

```
different time price configurations, the third day also came in on a 
2.88 harmonic, also different positions in the square, but the same 
ratio at the same time, so the pattern must repeat ,when this 
happens, this is harmonic analysis, the reason a person cannot see 
this with their eyes, is because you have no origin point to define 
time price configurations, its like walking down a five mile road 
and being asked to describe five things that repeated, not likely, 
same with the market, you need a fixed point to get points of 
mathematical force to determine when they happen again, then it is 
likely to repeat a pattern. 
 
 
I feel that the market you look at, any market you look at is an 
illusion, the time on the chart is an illusion, the price you look 
at is an illusion, but behind and back of the chart is the geometric 
solid that price and time are working off. When I say to you, "what 
time is it" and you say its 630 pm, and I say thanks, and we both 
agree that it is six thirty pm, but is it really six thirty pm ?, it 
is only 630 pm because we have a point of reference that we agree 
on, that we have been taught,that our body senses it is six thirty 
pm, at some point in time, we adopted a time system, but this time 
system is based on astro cycles, all time is based in some origin of 
an astro cycle. Ponder this. I am sitting on my porch, I am at zero 
aries or 360 pisces. I am Fred Flinstone, and hovering out in front 
of me is the great gazoo, he is not subject to the laws that i am, 
while im here on earth, so were talking and four, eight, twelve, and 
the sixteen minutes elapse and im moving and rotating right along, 
but ol gazoo remains fixed at the origin point, now we began talking 
at lets say 630 am, and time goes by some more and now i have moved 
90 degrees away from gazoo, but we are still talking and im turning 
the corner now, while he remains fixed at the starting point, 12 
hours later im now 180 degrees from gazoo, but he is still talking 
with me, i keep on moving around approaching the 270 degree position 
and we are still talking well enough, now I am approaching him 
again, as i am completing my revolution, when i get to where gazoo 
is, i have not quite completed my cycle yet, so continue past gazoo 
and stop some point further along the zodiac, ponder this goofy 
story well 
 
When the fellows in the movie quest for fire, wanted to know what 
time it is, one of the drooling low foreheads asked his partner what 
time is it, so he could go pick up his new issue of gentlemens 
quarterly. The drooling fellow checked his Rolex and responded, its 
1:44 pm. These fellows would have surely have been aware and watched 
the environment for constant feedback on how to cope and surive and 
learn something of the the situation, lets suspend our belief in 
time for a moment, and say that it doesnt exist, let say we had a 
square of nine, and we noticed that the seasonal time periods are so 
close the gann square that we cannot ignore these time periods. 
Geometry says that any circle no matter how small or large contains 
360 degrees, gann always said i measure everything with the circle, 
time, price, volume, space, whatever you want, then he says i put 
the square and the triangle inside the cirlce to get important point 
for resistance for either time, price, space or anything i want, how 
come none of you see or talk about, or figure on the earthly year of 
365 days to the circle in geometry, isnt that what gann screams at 
you with the square of nine, or do you think it just a square root
```

### Page 4

```
calculator, do any of you understand the ratio that the square of 
nine is built and designed on ?, the SEASONS are the time periods, 
thats what the MASTER CHARTS are built on and designed upon, its 
funny how want to make things so complicated, This rotating 
geometric solid you all wonder about, is your own earth, lol. Gann 
said everything has four sides, a ceiling and a floor, if you put 
144 cells on each side, to complete the building, you would need to 
run out 864 or the six square of 144, yesterday at 1130 am time was 
sitting on the middle of the square, the emini in price was sitting 
on a .720 time price relation with the time angle, that is your 
second circle, and its the fifth square of 144, the building is 
still under construction, you guys and ladies have much more math 
abilitiy than myself, my math skills are eighth grade level, but i 
dont need all that stuff, i can set any market in time and price 
correctly inside the master charts. 
 
 
In the master charts section of Ganns course, he speaks of how older 
stocks when price gets high, the swings are rapid and wide, he says 
this is because the forty five degree angles are further apart, this 
lends itself to the fact that vibratory nature of something changes 
as it gets older, that would lend itself to music theory. A number 
of years ago it was common to find those large wooden stereos in 
people houses, the kind with the turntable inside and the lifting 
top. When i was small, I used to clamp my teeth on the edge of that 
cabinet and then my bones would act as a conduit for the musical 
vibration, I have read other stories from people who described other 
kids doing the same. A deaf person could easily feel the music at a 
live show on the same basis. Music theory refers to different modes, 
such as Lydian, Phrygian, Locrian, Ionian, Dorian, Mixolydian and 
Aeolian. Some players like Carlos Santana, might be considered modal 
players because when you see him live, he can easily manipulate a 
crowd of people with tension, release, melancholy, brightness, this 
ability has something to do with a mode of playing, it appears it 
also has its origin in the way a band will comp his playing. Guitar 
players like George Benson and Wes Montgomery made a living playing 
octaves, where they strike two different strings, ie the same notes 
simultaneously, this is a very pleasing and interesting sound to the 
ear, like a marriage of sound, the notes have sympathetic resonance 
it seems. I belive the musicians term for this is, Harmonic 
Discordance. It appears as you stack the 144 squares on top of each 
other, the vibration of that particular square would change, it 
might be possible to build the 144 squares according to a diatonic 
scale, and the steps and intervals between might be a way to define 
vibration to particular numbers in the square, much the same as 
notes having their own vibration, this would lend itself to gann 
statement, the higer the prices go the faster the swings, depending 
on the position of the price and what square its in. This would be 
applicable to time angles, as numbers are numbers, if one vibrates, 
they all do. Find a all time low or high in a market, and take the 
22.5, 45, 90 points and you will see some vibrational laws at work. 
On page 169 of the master charts section Gann says, "Prices are 
governed by time and time causes prices to change and the time 
angles are the resistance to price. These are measured in hours of 
longtitude which are basic geometric angles and determine the change 
of trend" Why do the time angles of 36,45,54,72,81,84,90,108,126 
causes markets intraday to change trend, its because these time
```

### Page 5

```
angles are like brick walls to price when it gets there. When you 
measure time from the seasons, arent you measuring hours of 
longtitude ? and arent the basic geometric angles he speaks of the 
time angle that i speak of ? They arent if you describe the theory 
that a Gann angle must be a diagonal, but thats another story 
 
 
Below is a response…I have not included it, as its not Pure Prof…
 
 
Thats a intersting way to look at it yes, everybody sees things 
differently in their own mind, eye look at it like this, if you take 
your circle. 360 and divide it by 45 degree angles, you get eight of 
them, this is like the octagon that the martial artists use to throw 
and skeletal freeze someone. If you visualize this octagon on the 
ground with it eight even sections, these are the one eights gann 
spoke of, or for murrey math students, your eight square. Now 
visualize reaching down to the middle of the circle where all the 
lines intersect and pick it up, now the object looks different as it 
it standing up, this apex point that you picked up is your fifty 
percent point or the middle of the eights, this can be your forty 
five degree point, they all are forty five degree points, but this 
is the true gravity center of them. These price levels that the time 
angle creates can define whether the market under observation is in 
the bullish side of the square or in the bearish side, for the 
clever folks, this line of thinking can tell you where to put your 
gann fans intraday, when you know a point in space and time that is 
correctly defining the forty five degree angle, then the angles 
above and below the forty five can be the angles for the bullish and 
bearish side of the square. You can do lots of interesting things 
when you know what time angle is operating. 
 
The last time eye was in here, there was bitter discussion about 
copyright violations over some tired ass wheel of twenty four. Lets 
get on the track to some serious Do Re Mi, or perhaps Fa So La Ti 
Do. For some time now, I have had in my possession a time period 
that governs when the wheel returns to its origin. I acquired this 
from the akashic records. So then eyem thinking thinking thinking, 
did Gann operate on this same time factor, I refer you to A.S. 
Raleigh's book, Occult Geometry and Hermetic Science of Motion and 
Number, read the first page and you see that the wheel returns to 
its position, but when does this happen ? Gann made two statements 
that are the key to his trading application, the first one is, "time 
angles govern price", and the second one "Everything seeks a gravity 
center" The two laws that govern all matter are the law of 
heptaparaparshinokh and the triamazikanmo, ie, the law of seven and 
the law of three. Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do, an octave, monday tuesday 
wednesday thursday friday saturnsday sunsday and the repetition of 
the octave returning to the Do or monday, an octave, when twenty 
four of these octaves run out, the wheel returns to its position. 
This is 192 calendar days, THE time factor. In looking back from 
1940, our hero supreme was born on june ninth 1906, young Bobbie 
discovered his master time factor on june 19 1927, this is exactly 
7680 days from his birth, 7680 is forty octaves of 192 calendar 
days, turn to page forty and read how gann describes the WHEEL. 
Young Hero Gordon girlfriend Marie left him on june 5 1927 and 
returned August 30 1932, this is exactly 1913 days from her stage
```

### Page 6

```
left exit, Do you think these numbers were arbitrarily used ? ten 
octaves of 192 calendar days are 1920 days, but Gann returned her 
exactly seven days early, a Week, a diatonic octave, the law of 
seven, the law of vibration to show you the law. He chose the ten 
octaves because the number ten is the alpha and the omega, I refer 
you to Brydlovan theory of numbers, I also refer you to page seven 
and ten, and notice how Gann is again speaking of the WHEEL. Read 
professor OBJOYFUL analysis of the reason Marie left, notice his 
description of Uranus, Uranus sits 19.19 astronomical units from the 
Sun, check the position of Uranus on last date of the book, August 
30 1932, it sits at exactly 23 degrees aries, and if you use the 
circle, this would be 360 plus 23, 383 degrees, and the second 
octave of the master time factor is 384, one over, and this one is 
the ending and the beginning of the next cycle, The cycle of 192. 
Check the relationship of the 144 square to this 192, the difference 
is 48 units, hours, days, 192 is four octaves of 48, 48 days times 
24 hours is 1152, the eight square of 144 or the sixth octave of 
192, 48 hours times 60 minutes is 2880 the fifteenth octave of 192. 
Supreme commander gave the world fifteen days to respond, or 360 
hours. The earth year 365.25 divided by the time factor 192 is 
1.902, again the master repeating time factor. Now, eight days at 24 
hours is 192 hours, the first diatonic octave, and twenty four of 
these diatonic octaves is 192 calendar days, when the wheel is 
reset. 48 days times 24 hours in a day is 1152 hours, times 60 is 
69120 seconds, and this is the 360 octave of the master time factor 
192, proving up the relationship between 144 and 192, you can use 
the 144 square within the 192 CD octave. Our young hero discovered 
his time factor on 6 19 1927, Here Gann being at his cleverest, 
disguises the master time factor right in front of your EYE ballz. 
He teaches you the fib spiral first with 619, then he teaches you 
the master time factor of 192 CD, then finally teaches you the law 
of seven, ie the law of vibration. His tunnel kept pilot sleeping 
for seven days, his gas seven, on page 238 Gann discusses the law of 
three, with his positive, negative, neutral principles, the Do, FA, 
LA vibration, which deny, consolidate, and shock price levels. Gann 
sent his hero to Paris to keep him from losing his brain for thirty 
one days, 31 divided by the master time factor is 1618, he again is 
teaching you the fib spiral, which by the way is governed by the law 
of octaves in pascals triangle. Our other master guru, George Bayer 
knew the 192 day cycle, Bayer says the THING that moves the wheel is 
engraved on every violin made, go check that out, and see it is the 
moons node, the retro guy who goes backward 360 degrees every 
18.924024 days, and the 192 day cycle times 36 cycles is that moons 
node return. Knowing this time factor is only half of the gordion 
knot, I recommend you to the book Cosmic Secrets by Russell Smith, 
the best ever writtin on trading, learn the octaves and inner 
octaves, and then apply your time factor to get your gravity points 
where the price happily runs to every day without fail. At any 
moment in a markets action, it is simply moving to a gravity center 
between to stopinders on the diatonic scale, if you want the minute 
movment, calculate the minute octave, if you want the hourly 
movements caculate the hourly octaves and if you want the general 
direction of the market calculate the day time angles, is is simply 
wheels within wheels, I prefer octaves within octaves, between any 
two vibrations are inner octaves and inner octaves and inner octaves 
and inner octaves and inner octaves, Learn that book and you have 
the Gann dillemna solved. Let the hate mail Begin

Here is some proof the 192 cycle is valid, it appears there is some 
significane with Uranus, it is the seventh planet, giving to the law 
of vibration, also it is synodic period is seven octaves of 12 
signs, months. Also there is 18 days slippage of a perfect harmonic 
from 192 calendar days. 84 times 365.25 plus 21 days for leap give 
you 30702, 192 times 160 gives 30720, eighteen days off a perfect 
octave of 160. 2.618 plus 1 gives 3.618, the root of this number is 
1.902, this ratio is sared as it describes the diagonal of a golden 
rectangle, also it describes the side of the pyramid of Giza, the 
south furthest south angle from the top to the base. Using the 
planetary data up above, starting with mercury. Get the ratios 
between each two planets. 87.97 / 224.7 / 365.2 / 686.98 / 
4332.71 / 10759.5 / 30685 / 60190 / 90550 
 
.391, .618, .531, .158, .402, .350, .509, .667, add these numbers 
for 3.626, square root 1.904 proving the cycle validity. It proves 
up the circle, the earth year, the moon cycle, proves up a lot 
things. Notice that nine ojbects have EIGHT ratios between, once 
again the Diatonic Octave, Do, Re, Me, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do 
mercury, venus, earth, mars,jupiter, saturn, neptune, uranus, pluto. 
When you add the Son, i mean sun, perhaps Sol, Osirus, notice how 
Horus, the winged messenger, sits so close to parents, Osirus and 
Isis. If you take the reciprocal of 3.618, 1 / 3.618 you get 2763957 
Now divide that by the time factor 192, and you get 144, Ganns 
master time and price chart, the square of 12. The knowledge of the 
ancients is beyond comprehension. I recommend everybody read some of 
the builder of the CORAL CASTLE in Florida, try to figure out how 
this one hundred pound man moved over 31 tons of Coral, and overcame 
the laws of something we know nothing, Gravity, with laws we also 
know nothing about. In George Bayers four hundred years of astrology 
on page 142 and 182 he makes a couple interesting statements about 
what activates the agency in nature. Our universe makes the wildest 
science fiction look like a Dr Suess book. 
 
Poor Hero Gordon, his precious Marie giving the greasy eye to 
another fellow, causing Bobbie much of a troubled heart, making him 
punish the only one he wants, go figure that. Speaking of Masons, in 
one very old book, a young farmer asked the strange older guy, are 
you a Mason ?, the guys, yes I am, What is a Mason ?, A builder, A 
builder of what ?, A temple, A temple to what ?. If you read the 
very old books on Freemasonry, you will read paragraph after 
paragraph in the Tunnel, written word for word from these older 
books. Mr Gann certainly was in possession of very occult and 
esoteric knowledge, the way Mr Gann obtained much of this knowledge 
was not of his own intellect, although no one denies his mind was 
brilliant, this lends itself even more to the idea that Mr Gann
```

### Page 8

```
obtained his knowledge from the web of creation, the source if you 
will, I dont like to name it, so I wont. The information that I 
impart to you and write about, is not of my own intellect either, I 
get it from the web of creation. If this offends you, I apologize, 
if not drink deep, cause its the truth. The master charts are a a 
very cool thing when used right. First off the idea to get out of 
your head is to stop looking at those charts, plastic overlays, 
spirals charts as flat things, in your mind pick each one of them up 
with your thumb and forefinger at the very center, and LIFT it up, 
do this in your mind with every master chart you have, Give them 
Height, width, length, dimension, depth, and transparency, Lift them 
up like pyramids. Here is one idea, tape the master square of 144 up 
on your ceiling, let it hang from the ceiling, walk to the side of 
it, looking at the plastic chart from its edge, very thin now, with 
your hands reach out to either side of it, and grab it in the 
middle, pulling it out in opposite directions, now you have a ball, 
sphere, but keep the lines on this ball, the angles are now wrapped 
all around this ball. In your mind STEP inside this holographic 
sphere, and look around as your standing inside the center, and look 
out thru every angle, rotating yourself like a spinning vector, this 
is the fourth dimension of trading, now imagine the price action 
running around this holographic square of 144 converted into a 
global sphere. Here now is the missing element that I have never 
heard discussed before, When your trying to use these charts, for 
example, you need the use the master time factor that I wrote about 
previously, you can easily use ANY square, when ONCE the market 
under observation is SET in TIME correctly, when this is done, it 
does not matter what square you use, math is math. Example, square 
of 144, when you are day trading, you use hours, when 144 hours 
runs, out most people talk of returning the time back to zero, on 
the bottom left of the square, stop doing this, run the market up 
from the bottom right corner to the top right corner, when that 144 
time runs out, run the market from the top right corner to the top 
left corner, and when that runs out, run it down the fourth side 
from the top left to the bottom left or beginning, you calcuate the 
price the same way, always running the TIME around and around the 
square, from the bottom, up to the top, from the right top the to 
the left top, then back down, starting all over again. When you can 
do this correctly, you will know what those circles are for that are 
within the 144 square. This way you are advancing the market every 
twenty four hours along EACH face of the pyramid, grid by grid, 
constantly wrapping the Time as it passes thru each section of the 
pyramid, calculating the price and time squarings from the different 
SIDES of the square, this makes it a revolving sphere, which is what 
Gann developed these things. To quote from the movie, "If we live in 
gigantic spiral, and we are blueprinted from a sprial, then 
EVERYTHING we put our hands to, must be a spiral. Use your 192 
calendar count, use your 144 square within this count, and rotate 
the time count just like described above, and you will be delighted 
at what you see. 
 
Somethings are endemic to the race, such as the need to seek outside 
guidance from yourself. We seek everything everywhere outside of 
ourselves. We seek the source in a building with a cross on it. We 
seek the source from another individuals experience with it. We seek 
the source in others writings. But this source is within your own 
yard. The more you live in your vehicle body and the more ego you

generate the more separated you are from IT. The more you rely on 
your senses the more the illusion becomes. Your senses pick up only a 
small portion of the available octave for its vibrational spectrum. 
Which is the way the architect desinged it, giving us something in 
common, a particular wavelenth, change this dial and behold whats 
behind the looking glass. Seek the silence within yourself. On to the 
GAnn Meister. I have much of the Gann material, the books, the 
courses, the overlays, the hand drawn charts, all kinds of misc stuff 
along the periphery. Have you ever notice that NOWHERE does Gann talk 
in his courses and books like he speaks in his ticker digest 
interview ? These two different pieces of literature are as 
diametrically opposed as can be. Why ? Because what is in those 
courses is shortcuts designed by him for him. Leaving us in the dark, 
so lets put some white light on that. Here is my take on how Gann 
traded under observation and in the market pits perhaps, I imagine 
Gann holding a Tesla coil in his hand, a Wilhem Reich orgone 
generator attached to his a.., and a pyramid on his head. Now in his 
brain I see Faradays magnetic lines, complex regression analysis, 
fourier transforms, sine waves oscillating back and forth around a 
gravity center for bullish and bearish sentiment. Archimedes 
geometric solids rotating in three dimension inside his coconut. A 
Annunuki mother ship in a holding pattern 618 miles above him 
downloading the exact planetary relationships. A lot of folks will 
vehemently deny this statement. When Gann beat up the market in his 
thirties, he did this with a math model based on comsology of 
Ouspensky and Gurdjieff based on time angles. This celestial stuff 
came later in life with more experience and research. Remember these 
statements, "periodic undulation", "a time factor that repeats", "an 
entirely different law works on the ascension as from the 
descension", "the forces behind this motion are also under a law or 
state of vibration" "stocks are like gravity centers" "they are like 
electrons jumping orbits" "each stock has its own vibratory 
characteristic", "thus I affirm that all classes of phenomena fall 
under this law of vibration" I ask you, have any of you ever read a 
book besides the above cosmologists that have ever laid out the law 
of vibration for you ?, I doubt it, lots of books use the word 
vibration, but hardly a thorough course on what this is and how the 
model is laid out. Its music that most closely models this law. 
Pythagoras had the law and taught it. Prices simply oscillate around 
a rotating vector, ie the time angle, prices get below it, gain it, 
recover it, this is what is meant by time or price being ahead of one 
another. The idea that certain vibrations need to be shocked for the 
ascension, and certain ones need to be shocked for descension is the 
different rule Gann spoke of. Electrons have movement to a phenomena 
called spin up and spin down. It would be quite easy for Mr Gann to 
have in his head the law of octaves, and if trading he only need to 
know what time angle is operating, then simply encapsulate the market 
price in between two vibrations, then recalculate the octaves and 
there is the vibration, ie the prices that the market will bounce off 
of. All I do, is take the day time angle, and calculate the all to 
nothing octave, then calculate the two inner octaves from this. Find 
out where the market is, encapsulate the price between two 
vibrations, and from this is the Do, Re, Mi, Fi, So, La, Ti, Do. I 
have uploaded a file demonstrating this for the emini today, its a 
file called spookygravitycenters. Between the FA SO vibrations is the 
exact gravity center of the octave, and notice the price behavior at 
it, for the market to get strong its a good sign to see it shock the
```

### Page 10

```
SO vibration. I can calculate these prices in three minutes. Just 
riding the rock and rotating the time forward is all thats needed. 
Count out squares of 192 days from the markets first trading day and 
encapsulate the current time and apply the law of octaves as 
described in Cosmic Secrets and you will have all the tops and 
bottoms at your command. I know all of you think my antenna is bent, 
but ONE of you sometime will follow my steps, and you will say, damn, 
hes right. Here is the spooky book of the week. "The master key" by 
Mr Charles Chuck Hannell, and "Trading in the stillness" by Ricky 
Harris, and even a golden but oldie, "Torque Analysis" by Chucky 
Garrett. Let the rock roll and the conversations spin. 
 
eye dont think some people are following the foundation of what i am 
talking about. im sure some dont care either, but for those who are 
trying to get this, here is the time portion of what I do, in theory 
and application. the theory is this, 
do moonsday 
re tuesday 
mi wednesday 
fa thursday 
so friday 
la saturday 
ti sunday 
do monday 
 
most of the world conforms to this week, and we adjust our cycles to 
this divisions of night and day over a twenty four revolution of the 
earth. since there seven days of the week, this lends itself to the 
law of seven, and the diatonic scale is completed with the return of 
the eight position. since there are 24 hours in the day, we take the 
eight position at 24 hours per day, and we have the above octave 
which has 192 hours in it. This we call One octave of time, I stack 
24 of these octaves on that one octave, and this gives us 4608 hours, 
and this divided by 24 is 192 calendar days, So you ask why do you 
stack 24 octaves on this one beginning octave, for the simple reason, 
that we are here on this earth, and this is the earths cycle that we 
adjust ourselves with. so this is the theory behind the 192 cycle, 
and also with the 24 hour revolving of the earth, a lot of gann 
students are obsessed with the other planets, but were here, not 
there, sure there configurations combined with solar wind and 
magnetic force affects us, but its the earths own cyclic behavior 
that we are psychology wired up with. so then after we have run out 
192 calendar days we have run out 24 octaves of this base day of the 
week octave. the number 192 is really not as important as the 
understanding of where it comes from. the days of the week being 
seven, the hours of the day, being 24, and then twenty four octaves 
on top of this base freqeuncy of 192 hours for our base diatonic 
octave of the weekday. Which gives us 192 calendar days. this sets up 
a good time structure as it moves with the calendar, now gann counted 
calendar and trading time on his charts, and there is some truth to 
using trading hours, I can make it work to a certain extent, however 
it is not even remotely close to the power of following the calendar, 
in theory if you want to apply natural science to a market, the the 
idea of using trading hours needs to be abandoned. also when gann was 
trading the markets, the communication of the world was rather slow 
as today, and so the market participants were somewhat regular and 
predictable. But with todays global economy, incredible communication

capability and the ability to trade from any househould with internet 
capablility makes the stange attractors very chaotic and the only i 
know how to tame that is thru the law of octaves as applied from time 
angles, constantly rotating time forward when your time is correct. 
the practical application of that is obtained by using the first 
trading day of your market and then add forward 192 days which we 
assume is the return of the octave to its beginning again, and take 
the day after this day and add 192 days to that and take the next day 
after that day and add 192 again and again until your time is 
currently encapsulated inside the square of 192, you want to keep the 
squares of 192 separate from one another, do not overlap the number 
192 with the number one, separate the squares and rotate them 
forward, one by one. this is the theory and the application of what i 
have been talking about. The prices are generated from the time 
number, ie, the time angle according to the law of octaves at taught 
in cosmic secrets. most of you should be able to figure this out own 
your own, as i have given some examples of doing this, if your really 
interested i will teach you privately over a couple of days. But I 
think a good study of that book will give you the method. but let it 
be known, I have only scratched the surface of how to apply this, its 
enormously powerful, and a good thoughful application further from 
what im describing can by made by anybody, consider this, one chart 
for any day from 1 to 192 can be made permanent, and as long as your 
market is trading inside the numbers for that chart you have, you 
have a permanent accurate grid of prices for ALL TIME FOR ANY DAY OF 
ANY MARKET ,,,,,,,,,,,, FOREVER. 
 
 
all nothing octaves, your time is ascertained like this, find the 
first trading day for your market in question, i use this website. 
timeanddate.com. it does everything. add 192 days to this date, and 
from the NEXT DAY, add 192 more and follow this up till your 
current. for the emini, you can do two things, use the time count 
from the parent market, which is very accurate, or you can use the 
date of the emini start time, it also gives very accurate price 
projections, or use them both in combination to get very strong 
price projections. the theory holds that time positions give prices, 
and the balancing centers of the octaves draw prices to them. the 
clever person should also see that PRICES give the time when 
something to occure in a market, they are intimitely connected, time 
and price. page 39 in that book is basically the whole ball of wax. 
example, day today is day 110 
 
the emini is somewhere up around 1144, 
110,220,440,880,1760 
just encapsulate your price from this base frequency.

let the spinning rock do the work for you, smoke the markets, not 
the rock, and notice in ganns magic word, on page thirty eight while 
he is telling everybody to sing, chant, and VIBRATE THE 
YOD HE VAU HE, Gann even tells you to chant and sing the diatonic 
octave notes, its right there that his spooky law of vibration is 
now known to be the comsmological laws of the universe. the law of 
the enneagram. By the way Gann was a master metaphysician as 
indicated by the way he writes in that book, Gann speaks about 
light, and meditation, divine science he knew. 
 
Since you folks are dominating the conversation, lets bring some 
energy on, and this leads us to Billy Williams and his Crocodile. 
Williams says that new information is what causes market trends, ie 
strange attractors, he says that the markets are at least a seven 
dimensional animal, I mean crocodile. He says that markets are where 
they are, because that is where they are, and there is no such thing

as technical analysis. Preordained gravity centers from time angles 
might have something to say about that. Chucky Drummond says that 
there is no such thing as time, they eliminate that factor from 
there analysis, he also says that markets are framed by higher time 
periods, lower periods being dominated by the energy termination 
points of higher time frames, this is a wonderful concept and it 
appears to have much truth, since there is no such thing as time, 
but there is cyclic rotation of our earth we can take advantage of 
this new energy by following the behavior of our earth. Time seems 
to be mostly a function of our perception, our awareness needs to 
be, for time to be observed, and then the time passes very 
differently for all of us, depending on how we filter and process 
the enviroment. Chucky Drummond says that his point and line 
charting method shows were energy termination points, ie, tops and 
bottoms will occur before they occur by using certain lines drawn 
from the price bars themselves. He states that the bars themselves 
contain energy and thus have forecasting value when certain higher 
time frame configurations occur. Interesting for sure, that idea 
lends us to Kirlian photography that has shown sublte energy around 
the body for many years now. Mr Gann was one of the first to say 
that old bottoms will become future tops, and old tops will become 
future bottoms, how can this be ?, whether the elapsed time be a 
couple hours or twenty years, how can a point of energy in price, 
from the past make future traders behave in a certain way when the 
same cells are worked over ?, this lends us to this question, People 
who have lost limbs, report they still feel and see outlines of 
subtle energy where the limb used to be, How can this be ?, this 
energy must be not only be present, but it remains polarized at that 
time in space where it manifested originally. Gann theory states 
that a price level that acted as a pivot, for the rest of time spins 
out cycles of the same length in time, now imagine for a moment 
every price pivot for any market spinning out time factors forever, 
what a complex grid of energy, now imagine trying to track just the 
major ones, a task that makes no sense to try. You can see what a 
major complex lattice structure each market is. NOw Mr Gann spoke 
about markets who are moving into uncharted territory, have to work 
out the cells before they can advance, he also said the fourth time 
a market trid to break thru a grid of energy, was the time it made 
it, why is that you think ?, also Gann used the word, cells, why do 
you think he said a market has to work out the cells of uncharted 
territory, he knew it was energy spaces that needed to be worked out 
by the traders. Imagine Lewis and Clark going into uncharted 
territory, you know they were constantly taking feedback from the 
terrain and making constant adjustment and decisions from the 
environment, now once they laid tracks, and set up the psychic 
energy, the next guy and the next were easily able to duplicate the 
journey, until it was a worn path. This energy is precisely the same 
thing that is happening in the markets, the way to tame this energy, 
which is the law of vibration, is to use the law of vibration, which 
is the law of octaves, the laws of music theory. Think about why 
Gann said "time angles govern price, and the time angles are the 
resistance to price", and "these are measure in degrees of 
longtitude", ie, the rotating rock, and finally why he 
said "everything seeks a balancing center". This 192 calendar day 
cycle has 4608 hours of rotation in it, and these hours of rotation 
have also very precise gravity centers for something "to happen" 
within a market trading session. The word "everything" means
```

### Page 14

```
everything, so Gann said that everything that is a thing, seeks a 
balancing center. 
 
Eye used to crack up watching Hannibal and his crew bust the nutcase 
Murdock out of the mental hospital so they could go on a mission. 
Speaking of bent antennas, what I will say next will not do anything 
to ease your situation. After studying Gann for fifteen years, 
reading everything available, studying with professional traders, 
spending all my money on courses, I came to the conclusion, that 
everybody had parts of what Gann did, they could use the master time 
charts in a couple of specific ways, they did this and that, but 
nobody had the basis of what is, what it was, what its based on. I 
have meditated for a long time now, I learned how to access the delta 
level, and then I was taught how to employ white vibrational light, 
when you reach this level of meditation, your awareness of your body 
is completely gone, you are deep in the void of yourself, you are a 
ball of pulsating energy, when you can visualize and allow yourself 
to become a sponge of white vibrational light, you become immersed in 
what is a very cool, magnetic, and electric vibrational white light. 
Anyway one day in this state, I just told the universe to download 
into my brain every bit of market knowledge and information that has 
ever been in WD Ganns brain, and not only that but all information 
that has ever been about the law of vibration as applied to the 
markets. I dont have any lock on this stuff so I share it with you. 
Take a look at Mr Gann, does he seem like a good time Charlie to 
you ?, does he seem like the kind of guy who liked everybody he met, 
treated everybody great, he looks to me like the kind of guy who 
didnt take shit from anybody, and probably didnt like to be around 
people all the time. In his books he flat out states, that his 
knowledge of the law of vibration as applied to the markets is HIS, 
and would not be divulged, ever. He states that since he was in a 
position to help others with his master time factor and vibrational 
laws he offered a service to help people make sound investments. For 
anybody who is interested I want to explain what I mean about "the 
grid", let me say this, there are many ways to beat the market, once 
you can establish one way, you just exploit that until your wealthy. 
What I explain to you is the principle of the gann squares, namely 
the one called the master 144 price and time chart, I can use the 
square of nine, but that is a bit different, and I dont like it for 
this discussion. Gann called that square his master time and price 
chart, with the year 1955 on it, it has lots of green timing angles, 
the only one I have ever seen that is any good are made by Bill 
Mclaren. I am going to set up in your mind a model so you can 
envision what is happening with those squares, Imagine a globe, now 
heat shrink the plastic 144 overylay completely around that globe, to 
where this is a perfect fit and no slack, the grid is now wrapped up 
in perfect symetry around the sphere. Now make the the sphere 
holographic and transparent, and make it have depth, now imagine 
yourself sitting in front of this rotating sphere with all the grid 
lines on it, holographic. Now that we have that picture, try this, 
imagine this globe being solid in front of you, rotating like the 
earth does, now we are going to watch a market session unfold on this 
ball, the bell rings and out opens up section of 6.75 hours of space 
on this grid, the price inside this square according to where its at 
the time of the market session. This is the FACE OF THE GRID that is 
in operation for that market duration. The lines and angles only on 
that particular grid session dominate and control that sessions price
```

### Page 15

```
activity, its a unique roller coaster. The market closes, the face of 
the grid closes up, and the ball returns to normall with no windows 
open, the earth moves forward and the ball moves around. 24 hours 
elapsed of earth rotation, and the market opens up again, and 
immediately a new section of the grid appears, 6.75 hours of unique 
angle configuration with the price encapsulated in it. This is the 
face of this new session, and these angles dominate the price action. 
Every day a new piece of the grid opens up for that market session, 
so here is what Im saying, only a SWEEPING piece of grid dis-covers 
the market action for the duration of trading time. Just a sweeping 
pass of that very busy and complex grid. The way to mimick four 
dimensional price time trading is to rotate your market around and 
around the gann grid, each side at one time being the BOTTOM 
according to which square your in, you advance 24 hours across the 
grid every day, all days, according to the 192 master time factor, I 
have a square of 192, or you can use that 144 square. This way your 
just using a conical slice or section of the grid as it passes over 
and over and around the ball, but because our Gann square is flat, we 
mimick this four dimensional rotating ball describe above by doing 
what I just described. This leads me talk about this emini market 
today, This time period of 4608 hours has time gravity centers in it, 
an this is what happens, like today, when the TIME VIBRATIONS DO NOT 
FALL WITH THE TRADING SESSION the market gets flat, like today the 
first hour was a time gravity point, and the next gravity point fell 
out past the 6.75 trading session. So the market got going for a 
while but the energy was gone, and the market meandered around the 
gravity center, now what is happening is this, the TIME VIBRATIONS 
ENERGIZE the trading participants, the price frequencies are 
generated from the time angles, but the time vibrations themselves 
are the gas for the traders. When you have two or three good shocks 
of time vibrations WITHIN THE TRADING SESSION, this is what makes the 
moves good and fast, liquid, and fluid. Again, so you can follow what 
im saying, ONLY A SECTION OF THE GRID PASSES THRU EACH TRADING 
SESSION, THIS IS TRUE FOR TIME AND PRICE. Now perhaps you understand 
why the strange attractors are so wild, because the market opens up 
on a new face of the structure, the gann grid, the enneagram, the 
sacred lines of geometry, which are ALL encapsulated on the master 
time and price chart. Here is what Gann would have developed if he 
was born in the age of the integrated circuit, the final frontier, 
gann was a proponent of being progressive, as he said the man who 
does not continue to learn and study and try new things, will not 
make a success, because he refuses to admit he does not know all 
there is to know, so being progressive is good, and Gann was 
progressive, as you see he made four dimensional model of a plastic 
chart. The computer programmer who can perform this miracle of a 
three dimensional holographic sphere, rotating, constantly in front 
of you, with all the master time and price times lines on it, 
revolving in and in front of you, passing away from you and going 
round and round, so you constantly see the face of the grid that is 
ACTIVE for the session under consideration will have in their 
possession the most sophisticated and accurate trading model for time 
and price analysis that has every come down the pike from the 
spiritual realm. It would rotate at one degree every four minutes, or 
whatevery time speed you wanted it at, and the price would fall and 
rise according to the angles in operation for the specified period, 
this would all be done with the 192 calendar period, and the 4608 
time gravity centers would be on the grid, the octaves frequencies
```

### Page 16

```
would be lit up, this way you would know instantly which TIME 
VIBRATIONS AND WHICH PRICE VIBRATIONS ARE ACTIVE FOR THE SWEEP OF THE 
GRID FOR THE MARKET SESSION. You could be in a position over the 
market with such power, because you will never have to chase it, you 
will know when the press the market and when to leave it alone. 
Madness I tell you, but truthfull madness. Remember Gann said, the 
man who does not change his mind, will soon have no change to mind. 
Profits are kind of crazy with a spooky little price like you !! 
Try to get this inside of your mind, The time and price grids are 
PERMANENT, the only thing that makes them seem different is the TIME 
position, where is IT, in the procession, this is repetition in 
perfection, but it hides itself because of the TIME factor. 
Everything is going this time and price grid, but its the difference 
in the time position that makes it appear different. 
 
The book how to make profits on commodities should have been named, 
How i use the law of octaves in combination with time angles to get 
very accurate buy and sells. This post should gain me even some more 
unpopularity, and the reason is because what Im showing you is 
anticlimactic in a sense, because the search is over, the law of 
vibration is now exposed for what it really is, I have showed you 
how to square price and time with the master charts, what the true 
forty five degree angles really are, how history repeats on a grid 
of permanent resistance points for time and price. I have shown you 
in real time how the market absolutely goes to predetermined 
mathematical points of force even before the traders take it there. 
Eye suspect some of you who follow my posts and work,realize that 
indeed I am showing you how Mr Gann made 286 trades with 264 trades 
being profitable. Cause that is exactly what Im showing you, you 
will never see this work duplicated anywhere, unless of course you 
do it yourself. This is the first time that the law of vibration has 
been demonstrated in print and in real time as exactly Mr Gann 
employed and deployed it. In that book HOw to make profits, on page 
twenty four, the Gannster says "nature balances everything", and he 
says it on page twenty four, Screaming at you, that the rotating 
rock and its 24 hour repititive cycle is the KEY to it all. on page 
30 the Gannster makes a comment about the square of nine and how our 
earth year falls along the circle of geometry, he alludes to the 
Masonic royal cross, the heavenly passing of the sun shocking the 
seasons. Read page 34 and see how Gann tells you about Faradys 
mathematical points of force, and all tops and bottoms are in 
relation to some PREVIOUS HIGH OR LOW, LOL, this is not exactly 
true. Although it is when you do not ride the rock and turn the 
wheel. On page 34 under the title of Range of Fluctuations, GAnn 
made a mockery of his true law of vibration and gave his readers a 
very poor cheap imitation of the LAW. Dividing a range by the number 
eight is the most ridiculous thing, but Gann was not going to give 
it up. The entire Murrey Math system is primarily based on the 
paragraph right there, taking a perfect fractal and making octave 
shift changes as it moves thru its harmonic intervals, however with 
one HUGE mistake, it does not apply and take into consideration the 
retardation within the diatonic scale that occurs between the Mi Fa 
and Ti DO vibrations, and of course they do not have the 192 day 
calendar cycle. On page 36 mr Gann speak of the whole ball of wax 
right there, giving up the FA SO vibrations the true gravity center, 
and he also makes reference of the 2/3 or .666666666666 being the 
position between vibrations that takes it to the next vibration. On
```

### Page 17

```
page 37 mr Gann gives up one of the most Fantastic and failsafe ways 
to nail price levels, especially because he knew that price levels 
were preodained. on page 38 he makes a tremendous statement about 
the gravity center and he also uses the ROCK as his example, he also 
gave up the key in the magic word on page 38, where he tells you use 
the notes DO, RE, MI. On page 42 and 43 mr Gann talks about the Law 
of the Trines, the Forces of the Diatonic scale, Do, FA, LA, the 
positive negative and neutral principles of the Universe. Take a 
good look at the book, and what is all about, nothing but Time 
angles, and resistance levels, and gravity centers, but he tells you 
that you have to keep a record of all the activity to keep informed 
about levels from the past, as they are going to repeat, which is 
true, he fails to tell you that you only need to use the master time 
factor and apply the laws of vibration as you ride the rock and spin 
the wheel forward. By doing this you automatically dis-cover the 
price levels that must be shocked again as the wheel moves past the 
same point it has in the past, LOL, in the words of Russell 
Smith, "shocking isnt it", You the man Russell, you the man. Go to 
page 32 and read the sentence by Gann. "You must apply time cycles 
and time rules" he didnt you should, or it helps, he said 
you "must". But then he didnt tell you how to do that did he ?. Like 
I said before, there is not such thing as time, there is only rock 
rotation in longtitude and revolution. Imagine the grand architect 
holding billions of worlds, billions of life forms, billions of 
years, billions of galaxies in his I M A G E ination, all passing in 
his mind like a blink our eyes, and looks my way and says, "what 
time you got buddy", and I say why its 1:44 pm, and he says, "yeah 
right", lol. Take care you all 
 
 
Or Commander Cody says "never argue with a fool, cause he might be 
doing the same thing". The ever cryptic Gannster, most clever 
indeed, but perhaps not clever enough for the trained eye ball. Gann 
being schooled in the Kabbalistic, Hermetic, and Rosy Cross 
philosophy adopted the code and smybolic writing style of the priest 
craft throughout history. In Ganns magic word he is teaching you 
about sympathetic resonance as he speaks about your voice sending 
its wants and desires throughout the universe when you ring the 
sacred word "Jehovah", He tells you that this word rings "three" 
sylablles, and contains "seven" letters. Here he is trying to teach 
you the law of vibration with law of seven and three. The very laws 
you are learning in Cosmic Secrets. He speaks much of RADIO and how 
is it possible to send stuff thru air without being able to see it. 
Then he reminds you to not rely on your own EYE BALLZ so much, 
because that sensory organ is quite deceptive at times as to the 
truth of our universe. He speaks of illusions, pranic breathing, and 
mostly the law of correspondence, ie "as above so below". Now I know 
lots of you who read what eye right, say to yourselves "this 
harmonic guy kind of weird, talk kinda crazy, say goofy things", in 
your mind your saying to yourselves "can this 192 day calendar cycle 
be the master factor or is this guys antenna just seriously bent ?" 
How bout we bend the space time continuum and turn to page 192 in 
how to make profits, and read under time cycles, We look at Gann 
telling us to watch for the six and seven months for a change of 
trend, now this is kinda vague, but its not so vague when you 
consider the half point between six and seven months is very close

to 192 days. Now the Gann mann wrote a book called the wall street 
stock selector, now turn to page 192 in that book and I will quote 
the gannster here "CURTISS WRIGHT, THE TWO LEADING COMPANIES IN THE 
BUSINESS WERE WRIGHT AND CURTISS. CURTISS MADE EXTREME LOW IN AUGUST 
1921 WHEN IT SOLD AT 1 1/8. THEN ADVANCED TO EXTREME HIGH IN MAY, 
1928 WHEN IT SOLD AT 192 3/4. LATER IT WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH WRIGHT 
AEROPLANE COMPANY. THE WRIGHT BROTHERS BUILT THE FIRST AIRPLANE IN 
THE UNITED STATES AND MADE THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL FLIGHT" #$%$&*$@#! 
$$##@#^&%*^$#@##$%&&^^%%, are you friggin kiddin me, a reference on 
page 192 with a stock that went from 1 to 192, lol. Hmmmmmmmmm, who 
was these brothers who had eagles in there heart ?, but of course 
they was one of the first "tunnelers thru the air". Gann was in love 
with this stock called "radio", he talks about it with great 
affection saying it will be a leader again. This stock accurately 
describes the law of vibration. So Gann is very sympathetic with it, 
he speaks about it the way a sports better bets with his heart, 
knowing full well his team has no chance to win. You folks are going 
to make so much snap buying and selling these gravity centers your 
going to be surrounded with cement ponds and movie starz. 
 
Yes there are lines of force that are active during the market 
session. These are gotten from the Gann Grids, ie squares, I use the 
square of 192, however the 144 is also valid. The reasoning why they 
are valid is because we base everything on 24 hours of revolution, 
we only stack 24, 48, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, and so into infinity, 
we never would use a fraction of a day, because that would throw off 
our price frequencies. The reasoning behind this is that we want to 
be dynamic and we want real time calculations, we want to ride the 
rock forward. For whatever market you like and whatever exchange it 
resides at is irrelavant. When that market started, at that point in 
time a mathematical signature was created, a vibration was set up 
that forever puts out a frequency that is based on 24 hour harmonics 
from that base vibration. Now back to those gann grids you asked 
about. Every day for the market session a section of the grid is 
active, this is what Gann said when these angles are "active", You 
can use the 144 grid as it is alignment with the 24 hour frequency, 
or you can use the 192 grid which is the master repeating time 
factor. Let me digress for a moment and tell you why the grids are 
as they are. Papus wrote a book called "the tarot of the bohemians" 
he says its the absolute key to occult science, he was a very 
learned initiate. He says that the gypsies used the tarot to divine 
the future with these cards, the reasoning behind these cards is 
they contain everything that is in the collective unconscious of 
mankind. They are archetypal symbology of the nature of everything. 
Now back to these gann grids, these grids are a combination of 
sacred geometry, they contain the enneagram, they contain circles, 
triangles, squares, they are a conglomaration of all these ideas and 
mathematical lines of force. In essence they are archetypal 
symbology of trading patterns, traders psyche for a given point in 
space and time. This is why nobody can use them correctly is for 
that reason, they cannnot set them in time correctly. Now the charts 
are so busy, that you can put one on a high or low and you see it 
square it out, but its mostly hit and miss. In my earlier post I 
spoke of how to use them in the fourth dimension of trading, how to 
mimick that idea. So to answer your question, Yes we have the law of 
octaves which is the price frequencies I show on the chart, the gann 
grids show the active lines, and you could draw them on the chart, I
```

### Page 19

```
just look at the section that is active and get an idea as to what 
lines are dominating, ist just a companion to the law of octaves. 
NOw on to your question about time and price squaring, yes price and 
time square up all the time, this happens in a number of different 
ways, the one i demonstrated was one where the price and time were 
in equilibrium, they were the same number, this happens often, but 
it also reverse the trend on other numbers and configurations, this 
is what Gann said when he said, I use mathematical sequencing, as 
there are relationships between points of squarings. On to your time 
question, yes the times of when the highs and lows can be gotten 
also, this is just done with the law of octaves. The time when 
something is going to happen is just another balancing act or center 
that is calculated from ....... I have given hints as to how this 
id done in my charts and posts. Reread my post and more will come to 
you. I have laid down the basic idead as to how to apply the law of 
vibration to a market, the more advanced theory and application will 
only be imparted on a one to one basis, where I can show you over 
many hours and charts how the price and time squares up, how to use 
the master charts, how to get the time balancing centers and more, 
in essence all that I know. Well now all this good vibrational talk 
gears me up for a listen to the beach boys classic rock tune. Light 
speed everybody

Intraday trade using gann angle principle 
 
In my book on “Gann Method” though I have explained 
various principles of W.D.Gann’s method and  its 
application on the stock market but the one which inspired 
me a lot is  “Gann angle” principle. The Gann angle is 
defined as the set of trend lines drawn from an individual 
price point or from different price points (i.e. high, low, and 
midpoint) in order to identify the supports and resistances 
of a future price move.  At this stage, do not worry much 
about this definition. It will become simpler as you proceed 
to the next part of this article.  The next big thing about the 
gann angle trend lines are that they are drawn at a particular 
angle with respect to the X-axis or to the time line. This 
concludes the basic formation of gann angle trend lines.  
 
Now let me explain this concept with the help of an 
example. Say I wish to draw a trend line at 1X1 (read it 
“one by one”) gann angle. This means my trend line is a
```

### Page 2

```
straight line drawn in the price time chart which makes an 
angle 45 degree with the X-axis.  You must ask me that 
how I have derived the 45 degree. Quite simple! This is a 
trend line drawn assuming 1 unit of price change happens 
with 1 unit of time change. If I will plot 1 unit of price 
change with respect to 1 unit of time change in a semi log 
scale and measure the angle with the help of a protractor I 
will get the angular measurement as 45 degrees.  
 
 
For making an intraday trade decision we need a point to 
make buy or sell entry. We need a stop loss point and 
couple of target points. Though this job can be done with 
any guess work but we need perfection. The perfection will 
be achieved only through the mathematical calculation 
which is accepted by the market. 
 
W.D.Gann has given us 11 different trend lines which will 
guide us in making a trade decision.  These trend lines are 
drawn based on the geometrical angle proportion in X and 
Y axis. For example the 2X1 (2 by 1) trend line is drawn 
assuming the 2 unit of price raise or fall happens in 1 unit 
of time.  This trend line makes geometrical angle of 63.75 
degrees with X-axis when drawn from a lower price point 
and projected towards the higher price points. Similarly this 
trend line will make 26.25 degrees with respect to x axis 
when it will be drawn from a higher price point and project 
towards the lower price point. This is the mathematical 
logic available in origin shifting, parallel line algorithm.
```

### Page 3

```
Now the 11 sets of trend lines from a lower price point 
towards the higher price point are as follows  1X1, 1X2, 
2X1, 1X3, 3X1, 1X4, 4X1, 1X8, 8X1, 1X16 and 16X1.  
 
The geometrical angle made by these trend lines with the X 
axis in an up move corresponding to 2X1= 63.75 degrees, 
1X2= 26.25 degrees, 1X1= 45 degrees, 1X3= 18.75 
degrees, 3X1= 71.25 degrees, 4X1= 75 degrees, 1X4= 15 
degrees, 8X1= 82.5 degrees, 1X8= 7.5 degrees, 1X16= 
3.75 degrees, 16X1= 86.25 degrees. 
  
The geometrical angle made by these trend lines with the X 
axis in a down move corresponding to 1X2= 63.75 
degrees, 2X1= 26.25 degrees, 1X1= 45 degrees,3X1= 
18.75 degrees,1X3= 71.25 degrees,1X4= 75 degrees,4X1= 
15 degrees, 1X8= 82.5 degrees,8X1= 7.5 degrees, 16X1= 
3.75 degrees,1X16= 86.25 degrees. 
 
Gann Formula for calculating the support and 
resistance:  
 
In gann study the 180 degree is considered as factor 1. This 
is because between the sun rise to sun set the solar motion 
happens approximately 180 degrees and it is considered as 
1 day time.  
 
The 2nd universal concept accepted by the financial analysts 
is that the supports are always calculated in a falling trend 
and it used to be calculated from the high.
```

### Page 4

```
The 3rd universal concept accepted by the financial analysts 
is that the resistances are always calculated in a falling 
trend and it used to be calculated from the low. 
 
Gann formula for calculating the support and 
resistance is as follows: 
 
a. Support = (square root of (high)- Degree factor)^2 
b. Resistance = (square root of (low) + Degree factor)^2 
 
Trading Rules as per gann and as modified by me 
(Soumya Ranjan Panda Author of this article) 
 
a. The 3rd support or resistance of any price move is 
important (as per W.D.Gann). 
b. In intraday trade 45 degree support break (1X1 
support) will favor sellers and 45 degree resistance 
(1X1 resistance) break will support the buyers. 
Provided the annual volatility of the trading 
instrument  must be higher than 50% (as per my own 
research ) 
c. In low volatile or medium volatile market (i.e. the 
annual volatility of the trading instrument is less than 
50 %) the (1X4= 15 degree) resistance and (4X1=15 
degree) support must be utilized for long and short 
entry provided no congestion or entry error should be 
present in the calculated price. (as per my own 
research ) 
 
d. If sell entry price at 15 degree or at 45 degree  greater 
than buy entry price at 15 degree or 45 degree price
```

point then it is considered as error and rectified by 
changing calculation procedure from the high and low 
to mid point of high and low. This says that instead of 
calculating the supports down from high and up from 
low you can calculate the same from the mid point of 
high and low (as per my own research ) 
 
e. If the price unit of the trading instrument is a 4 digit 
number then between the buy entry and sell entry 
price at least 5 unit difference is required to take 
unbiased decision as per this principle or else it is 
considered as congestion and it is rectified by 
changing the high and low to mid point. (as per my 
own research ) 
 
 
f. If the price unit of the trading instrument is a 3 digit 
number then between the buy entry and sell entry 
price at least 3.5 unit difference is required to take 
unbiased decision as per this principle or else it is 
considered as congestion and it is rectified by 
changing the high and low to mid point. (as per my 
own research ) 
 
g. If the price unit of the trading instrument is a 2 digit or 
single digit number then it must be converted to 4 digit 
number by the way of multiplying it with 10 or 100 or 
even with 1000 and the resistances and supports will 
be derived from the 4 digit number. And the results 
need to be dividing by the multiplier to reconvert it 
back to its original form. (as per my own research )
```

### Page 6

```
h. The smallest time interval in which you can identify 
the high and low is 5 minuets after the opening bell or 
the highest time interval you can consider is the 1st 15 
minute after the opening bell.  Any auction period 
must be ignored. Like now in Indian market 9 a.m. to 
9 :15 is considered as call auction period. Hence the 
data from 9 a.m. to 9:15 a.m. must be ignored (as per 
my own research ) 
i. If any trade of yours triggers the stop loss or trailing 
stop loss then do not reenter the  trade in the same 
direction again. 
 
As a day trader speculation is my profession and I will 
follow these calculations like religious testimony.  
 
Example:  on 11th November 2010 SBI between 9:15 
to 9:30 a.m. made high 3238.35 at 9:16 a.m.  low 
3214.10 at 9:27 a.m. below given the intraday chart 
for your reference.

paid calculator which is given along with the master 
course validates more number of logical conditions and 
infuses more number of gann principles in the decision 
making so as to give you greater success in intraday 
trade.) 
 
As per the above discussion and calculation procedure we 
have made the calculation of resistances and supports. As 
per the current volatility condition we are being advised to 
buy the stock at 3223.5558 or sell at 3228.8725. This is 
violating the point D trade principle and considered as an 
entry error henceforth we will change the high and low to 
its mid point and do the calculation from the mid point the 
mid point of 3238.35 and 3214.10 is 3226.225 . The

As per the modified calculation we are advised to buy at 
3235.6986 for final target 3280.8878 and sell at 3216.7653 
for final target of 3172.0214 
 
Trade outcome:  
1. At 9:34 a.m. We got a chance to sell at 3217 and kept 
out stop loss at 3235.70 this as per our calculation. Upon 
achieving the 1st target 3214.4we trail to stop loss to 
3216.80, then upon crossing the 2nd target we trail the stop 
loss to 3214.40. Unfortunately after touching the low 3211 
at 9:39 a.m. the trailing stop loss triggered at 3214.40 and 
we just bagged less then +3 points. 
2.  Considering our short trade adventure is wrong and as 
per the last protocol set in the trade rule we waited for the 
3235.70 to come which we have got a chance at 10:07 a.m. 
and achieved till 3254 till 11:27 a.m. which is close near to 
our 45 degree target point.  
 
If you are not quick in changing the stop loss also it will 
not dampen your trade performance.  
In this case if my shell stop loss triggered at 3235.7 I will 
accept close near to 18.9 point loss and be a buyer at this

point keeping the stop at 3235.7 and aim for the last target  
3281 with some logical trailing stop loss.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
This concept works in commodity, currency as well as in 
stocks.  
 
However the limitation of this article is that it does not 
discuss all the trading rules and conditions which are being 
researched by me. In the gann master course the supplied 
software uses all the extended set of logics.  
 
 
Day trading using Gann Angle dynamic approach: if we 
will make use of the volatility along with the gann angle 
then this concept will become dynamic and it will produce 
great result. All the above process that I have explained in
```

### Page 11

```
the earlier section will remain same only additional 
parameter daily volatility will be used with the gann angle. 
In this method, we will calculate the daily volatility based 
on the past 10 days last trade price of any instrument. 
 
1. Daily volatility calculation:  
a. Take past 10 days last trade price of any stock or index. 
b. Calculate the absolute return by using the natural 
logarithm function LN(). You will get 9 data points. 
Formula:  
Absolute return = LN (Current price/ Previous price) 
c. Calculate the square absolute return for all 9 data  
    points. 
d.Calculate the average of absolute return and square 
absolute return. 
e. Calculate variance.  
Formula: 
Variance = square absolute return – (absolute return)2  
f. Calculate daily volatility percentage. 
 Formula: Daily Volatility percentage = square root of 
(variance) X 100. 
 
From the daily volatility percentage, we understood in the 
coming day the stock or index whose daily volatility 
percentage was calculated as per the above process would 
fluctuate to the extent of daily volatility percentage. 
 
I have taken the state bank of India 12 October to 25 
October 2011 to predict the intraday level for next trading 
session   using the gann angle and the volatility.

Daily Volatility % 
  
1.526570684 
  
 
Above calculation says the daily volatility is 1.5266%. 
Hence, the stock has the probability to fluctuate by 
1.5266% in the coming day. Base on the above conclusion I 
will see a price fluctuation of 28.1233 (i.e. 1842.25 x 
1.5266/100) rupee in the sbi counter in future trading 
session. 
 
Hence my expected high is 1842.25+28.1233 =1870.3732 
my expected low is 1842.25-28.1233=1814.1268. 
 
Now in order to get the buy sell level in the gap up opening 
with uptrend I will use the 1842.25 as low and 1870.3732 
as high in the gann angle tool and follow all its rules to 
derive the targets.  
Using the above price points I observe that the trading 
rule–d is being violated, hence I have done the changes in

In the future trading session which follows the 25th october 
2011 any gap up opening above 1849.14 and below 
1863.50, if the price cross over 1863.50 then I will buy sbi 
for optimum target of 1898 and any gap up opening and 
price below 1849 I will sell for target 1815.25. 
 
Similarly, to get the buy sell levels in the gap down 
opening and downtrend I will use the 1842.25 as high and 
1814.1268 as low in gann angle tool and derive the targets. 
 
Using the above price points I observe that the trading 
rule–d is being violated, hence I have done the changes in 
the data point to 1828.19 (i.e. midpoint of the above data 
points) and derive the following levels for the future 
trading session.

Trend termination point: Gann angle also helps us in 
identifying the trend and the trend termination. 1 X 4 or the 
4 X 1 angle price point cross over is known as the 
preliminary trend confirmation points for uptrend or 
downtrend. However, the 1 X 1 angle price resistance 
crossover signals the strong up trend break out and the 1 X 
1 angle price support break considered as strong down 
trend break out. In gann angle concept we assume all the 
trend action will terminate at 1 X 16 or 16 X 1 angle price 
point.  
 
Dynamic gann square of nine principles: Using the 
volatility we can make any gann method dynamic. In gann 
square of nine principle, we need to derive the uptrend 
price points in the wheel by adding the step to the lowest 
number and each higher number in the wheel will be its 
preceding number added with the step. Similarly the 
downtrend price points will be calculated by subtracting the 
step from the highest number. Step is nothing but the high 
to low price difference divided by 81 for square of nine 
wheel. While using the gann square of nine for deriving the 
short-term investment decision I found the principle yields 
good result. However when applying the same concept in 
the intraday trade I did not get the desired result which I 
was expecting from the method.  This is the reason why I 
have thought of to introduce the volatility in this method.
```

### Page 17

```
Now the key question is how the volatility will find a place 
in this method. As I have explained before the daily 
volatility, percentage is the expected price fluctuation. 
Hence, now we will take the expected price fluctuation to 
derive the steps. Consider the same example of SBI given 
in page 105. The daily volatility percentage is 1.5266, 
expected price range is Rs 28.12, and the last trade price is 
1842.25. 
 
Step will be 28.12/81=0.347160 
Seed number will be 1842.25+0.347160 this will be the 1st 
number in the square of nine wheel. Second number will be 
1st number added with 0.347160 .Likewise the 81st   
number will be 80th number added with the 0.347160 and 
this must be equal to 1842.25+28.12=1870.3732 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dynamic gann square of twelve principles: The way i

will make the square of 12 dynamic. I will use the daily 
volatility percentage to find the price range for the day 
followed with I will calculate the steps by dividing the 
price range with 144. The seed number in the uptrend 
will be the last trade price added with the step and the 
144th number will be 143rd number added with the step. 
However do remember the square of 12 wheel is a 
different from the square of nine wheel in many aspects 
the arrangement of numbers are also different. The 
downtrend price points will be calculated by the way of 
subtracting the step from the last trade price.  
 
While using Dynamic Square of nine or dynamic square 
of twelve wheels keep a close eye on the annual 
volatility percentage. Annual volatility is nothing but the 
daily volatility multiplied with square root of 365. If the 
annual volatility is above 40% use the square of twelve 
wheel else use the dynamic square of 9 for making the 
intraday trade decision.
